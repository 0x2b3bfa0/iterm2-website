			If checked, the cursor will blink slowly to improve visibility.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Draw bold text in bold font</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, bold text will be drawn in a bold version of the selected font. If the font does not have a bold version, then a bold appearance is simulated by "double striking" the text: that is, drawing it twice, shifting it one pixel horizontally the second time.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Draw bold text in bright colors</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, bold text will be drawn in a bright version of its color.
		</p>

It is recommended that you use the same point size for both regular and non-ASCII fonts. Select "Anti-aliased" to draw the text with smooth edges.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Treat ambiguous-width characters as double width</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			Some characters (e.g., Chinese ideograms) are double-width, and take two cells to display. Other characters (e.g., Latin letters) are single width and take only one cell to display. There is another category of characters known as "ambiguous width". One example of ambiguous-width characters are Greek letters. Depending on your application, you may prefer to display them as double-width or single-width. If most of the text you deal with is double-width, then you should enable this setting as it will help things to line up correctly in that context.

		<h5>Profiles > Window</h5>
		<hr>
		<h6 class="question">Transparency</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			This sets the transparency of the window background. It can be temporarily disabled with View > Use Transparency.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Blur</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, the window background is blurred provided the background has some transparency. Selecting a large radius will blur the background more, but (especially on Retina displays) comes with a performance penalty.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Rows/Columns</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			When creating a new window with this profile, it will be created with this many rows and columns.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Background Image</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			This allows you to select an image to display behind the terminal's text. If Tile image is selected, then the image will be shown at its actual size and tesselated; otherwise, it will be stretched to fit the whole pane. The blending slider determines how strongly the image dominates over the text's background color.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Style</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			This defines the window style. Bottom- and Top-of-screen windows will disregard the columns setting. Left-of-screen windows will disregard the rows setting. Full-screen windows only respect the rows and columns setting when full-screen mode is exited.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Screen</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If you have more than one screen connected, this lets you select the screen on which a new window should open. It is particularly useful for fullscreen and top-of-screen window styles.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Space</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If you have enabled Spaces (or your OS uses Desktops instead of spaces) and have set Spaces/Mission Control to use Control+Number to switch spaces/desktops, then you can use this setting to select the initial space/desktop to open a new window using this profile.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">If showing profile name in tab title, keep it when the title is changed</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			You can specify that profile names are shown in window and tab titles under Preferences > Appearance > Show Profile Name. If that is not set, then this option is irrelevant. When in use, a host may send an escape code that changes the window title. This setting causes the profile name to be preserved in that session-set title.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Disable session-initiated window resizing</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If the host sends an escape code to resize the window, it will be ignored if this option is selected..
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h5>Profiles > Terminal</h5>
		<hr>
		<h6 class="question">Scrollback lines</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			The number of lines of scrollback buffer to keep above the visible part of the screen. Unlimited scrollback will allow it to grow indefinitely, possibly using all available memory.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Save lines to scrollback when an app status bar is present</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			Some programs (such as vim or tmux) keep a status bar at the bottom of the screen. For some applications (like vim) it is undesirable to save lines to the scrollback buffer when the application scrolls. For others (like tmux) you may want to save scrolled-off lines into the scrollback buffer. When this setting is enabled, lines scrolled off the top of the screen in the presence of a status bar are added to the scrollback buffer. The screen is considered to have a status bar if it has a scroll region whose top is the first line of the screen and whose bottom is above the bottom of the screen.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Save lines to scrollback in alternate screen mode</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			When in alternate screen mode, lines that scroll off the top of the screen will be saved to the scrollback buffer only if this option is enabled.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Character encoding</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			The encoding to send and receive in. For most people, "Unicode (UTF-8)" is the right choice.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Report terminal type</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			The TERM variable will be set to this value by default. If xterm-256color is selected and your system is missing the terminfo file, you will be prompted to install it when you open a new session.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Enable xterm mouse reporting</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, applications may choose to receive information about the mouse. This can be temporarily disabled by holding down Option.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Allow terminal to report window title</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			Programs running in a terminal may send an escape code to request the current window title. You may disable this feature by enabling this option. It should be disabled if you're communicating with an untrusted party, as there are possible injection attacks.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Use modern parser (experimental)</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			iTerm2 includes an experimental parser for CSI codes that should produce more correct results, but it isn't tested enough to be on by default. Enable this option to use it.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Disable session-initiated printing</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If enabled, escape codes that initiate printing will be ignored.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Disable save/restore alternate screen</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			Some programs (such as vim, tmux, and less) switch into a so-called "alternate screen". A characteristic of this behavior is that when these programs terminate the screen's contents are restored to their state from before the program was run. If this option is selected, alternate screen mode is disabled and the screen cannot be restored by an application.

		<h6 class="question">Triggers</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			Triggers are actions that are performed when text matching a regular expression is received. Each trigger has a regular expression, which defines when it runs. It has an action, which defines what it performs, and it has an optional parameter, whose meaning depends on the action. When the parameter is textual, \0 is replaced with the entire match, and \1...\9 are replaced with match groups.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Action: Bounce Dock Icon</h6>
		<p class="answer">

		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Action: Highlight Text</h6>

		<h6 class="question">Action: Run Coprocess</h6>
		<p class="answer">

		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Action: Run Silent Coprocess</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			When text matching the trigger is received, a silent coprocess is started. A silent coprocess differs from a regular coprocess in that input goes only to the coprocess and not to the terminal display. This is useful, for example, for ZModem transfers. The parameter gives a command to run as the coprocess.
		</p>

		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Smart Selection</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			Smart selection allows you to define a set of regular expressions, each with an assigned priority, that are used for making the best possible selection. By default, a quad-click invokes smart selection. Smart selection is described in full in the Smart Selection document.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Semantic History</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			Semantic history is used to open a file when you Cmd-Click on it. The current working directory for each line in the terminal is tracked to help find files. If Semantic History is set to "Open with default app," then files are passed to the OS to be opened with whatever is associated. Alternatively, you can choose "Open URL..." to open a specific URL (with \1 replaced with the filename and \2 replaced with the line number, if applicable). If you choose "Open with editor..." then text files will be opened with the designated editor, while other files are opened with the default app for their file type. For more flexibility, choose "Run command..." and specify a command to execute. \1 will be replaced with the file name, \2 will be replaced with the line number (if applicable), \3 with text in the line prior to the click location, \4 with text in the line subsequent to the click location, and \5 for the working directory of the line clicked on. Finally, "Always run command..." is like "Run command...," but takes effect even if the object clicked on is not an existing filename.
