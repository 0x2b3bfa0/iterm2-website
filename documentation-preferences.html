		iTerm2 should require little explanation for users accustomed to terminal emulators. Even if you are an experienced user, take the time to read through the <a href="documentation-highlights.html">highlights</a> section of this document. It will familiarize you with some features of iTerm2 that you may not have seen in other terminal emulators that can make a real difference in the way you work.

		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Smart cursor color</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			When selected, a block cursor will be displayed in reverse video. If this would result in confusion, then a different color is chosen that will be most visible given the surrounding cells' background colors.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Minimum contrast</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If text is displayed against a similar background color, the minimum contrast setting will move the text color towards black or towards white to ensure some minimum level of visibility. Setting this slider all the way to maximum will make all text black and white.
		</p>

		<p class="answer">
			If checked, the cursor will blink slowly to improve visibility.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Draw bold text in bold font</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, bold text will be drawn in a bold version of the selected font. If the font does not have a bold version, then a bold appearance is simulated by "double striking" the text: that is, drawing it twice, shifting it one pixel horizontally the second time.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Draw bold text in bright colors</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, bold text will be drawn in a bright version of its color.

		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Treat ambiguous-width characters as double width</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			Some characters (e.g., Chinese ideograms) are double-width, and take two cells to display. Other characters (e.g., Latin letters) are single width and take only one cell to display. There is another category of characters known as "ambiguous width". One example of ambiguous-width characters are Greek letters. Depending on your application, you may prefer to display them as double-width or single-width. If most of the text you deal with is double-width, then you should enable this setting as it will help things to line up correctly in that context.

		<h5>Profiles > Window</h5>
		<hr>
		<h6 class="question">Rows/Columns</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			When creating a new window with this profile, it will be created with this many rows and columns.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Style</h6>

			This defines the window style. Top-of-screen windows will disregard the columns setting, while full-screen windows only respect the rows and columns setting when full-screen mode is exited.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Screen</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If you have more than one screen connected, this lets you select the screen on which a new window should open. It is particularly useful for fullscreen and top-of-screen window styles.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Space</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If you have enabled Spaces and have set Spaces to use Control+Number to switch spaces, then you can use this setting to select the initial space to open a new window using this profile.

		<p class="answer">
			This allows you to select an image to display behind the terminal's text.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Server-set tab title preserve profile name (if shown)</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			You can specify that profile names are shown in window and tab titles under Preferences > Appearance > Show Profile Name. If that is not set, then this option is irrelevant. When in use, a host may send an escape code that changes the window title. This setting causes the profile name to be preserved in that session-set title.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Disable session-initiated window resizing</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If the host sends an escape code to resize the window, it will be ignored if this option is selected..

		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Silence bell</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, the bell (control-G) will not make an audible sound.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Bell icon in tabs</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, tabs will indicate that a bell has rung by displaying a bell graphic.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Visual bell</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, a bell graphic will be flashed when the bell character is received. This can be tweaked with a hidden setting to use a traditional visual bell (e.g. flashing the whole screen) instead of the graphic:
		</p>	
		<div class="panel code">
			<pre>
				defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 TraditionalVisualBell -bool true
			</pre>
		</div>
		<h6 class="question">Character encoding</h6>
		<p class="answer">

		<p class="answer">
			The number of lines of scrollback buffer to keep above the visible part of the screen.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Save lines to scrollback when an app status bar is present</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			Some programs (such as vim or tmux) keep a status bar at the bottom of the screen. For some applications (like vim) it is undesirable to save lines to the scrollback buffer when the application scrolls. For others (like tmux) you may want to save scrolled-off lines into the scrollback buffer. When this setting is enabled, lines scrolled off the top of the screen in the presence of a status bar are added to the scrollback buffer. The screen is considered to have a status bar if it has a scroll region whose top is the first line of the screen and whose bottom is above the bottom of the screen.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Report terminal type</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			The TERM variable will be set to this value by default. If xterm-256color is selected and your system is missing the terminfo file, you will be prompted to install it when you open a new session.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Enable xterm mouse reporting</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, applications may choose to receive information about the mouse. This can be temporarily disabled by holding down Option.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Disable save/restore alternate screen</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			Some programs (such as vim, tmux, and less) switch into a so-called "alternate screen". A characteristic of this behavior is that when these programs terminate the screen's contents are restored to their state from before the program was run. If this option is selected, alternate screen mode is disabled and the screen cannot be restored by an application.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">When idle, send ASCII code</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected, the specified ASCII code will be transmitted every 30 seconds while nothing is happening. Don't use this unless you know what you're doing as it can have unexpected consequences.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Enable Growl notifications</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If selected and Growl is installed, iTerm2 will post a Growl notification when sessions receive output, become idle, ring the bell, or close.

		<h6 class="question">Ignore</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			The keypress will do nothing.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Do not remap modifiers</h6>
		<p class="answer">

		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Remap modifiers in iTerm2 only</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If modifier remapping is in effect (set under Preferences > Keys), it can be set to not affect other applications that may listen for global hotkeys. When you choose this action, modifier remapping is temporarily disabled so you can press the key combination unremapped in the key field.
		</p>

			This action allows you to enter the name of an iTerm2 menu item. It must be entered exactly the same as it appears in the menu. Ellipses can be typed with option-semicolon.

			You can add a new keymapping by pressing "+". You can remove an existing mapping by selecting it and pressing "-". Three presets are provided: "Xterm defaults" is the normal key mappings, while "Xterm defaults with numeric keypad" disables the "application keypad" in favor of the numbers and symbols that the numeric keypad typically emits. "Terminal.app Compatability" tries to emulate the way that Terminal.app sends keys by default.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Left/Right Option Key Acts As</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			It is common to use a modifier to send so-called "meta keys". For most users, selecting "+Esc" here is the right choice. The "Meta" option sets the high bit of the input character, and is not compatible with modern systems.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Delete sends ^H</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			If you are on a legacy system that does not accept ^? for backspace, select this and it will add a key mapping for you.

If it is the foreground app, it will be sent to the back. This requires that you enable access for assistive devices in the Universal Access panel of System Preferences.
		</p>
