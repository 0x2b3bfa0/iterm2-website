#### iTerm2 2.0 Released
<i>Sunnyvale, CA&mdash;July 14, 2014</i>

After three years of development, the second major version of iTerm2 has been released. It adds dozens of new features, countless bug fixes, and smells April fresh. Here are just a few of the new features you'll find:
 
  * Deep tmux integration. iTerm2 can speak directly to tmux and display its virtual windows as native windows or tabs, making tmux much easier to navigate.

  * A <i>toolbelt</i> has been added. The toolbelt a drawer that opens to the right of a window and shows running jobs, paste history, a field for taking notes, and facilitates opening new sessions.

  * iTerm2 now supports <i>triggers</i>. A trigger defines an action that is performed when text matching a regular expression is received. For example, it can highlight errors in red, bounce the dock icon when a build finishes, or respond to prompts for you automatically.

  * Literally dozens of new preferences let you customize every aspect of your terminal.

  * New proprietary escape sequences integrate terminal apps, allowing you to change a session's profile automatically, manipulate the pasteboard remotely, bounce the dock icon, and much more.
