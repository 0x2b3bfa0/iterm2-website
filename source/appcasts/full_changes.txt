iTerm2 version 3.2.3

Bug fixes:
----------
- Fix bug that broke subpixel antialiasing on
  macOS 10.13.
- Fix support for subpixel antialiasing on Mojave.
  Previously, if you had enabled this hidden OS
  feature, text would be very hard to read.
- Fix rendering of double-struck bold with GPU
  renderer.
- Get thin strokes working on macOS 10.14 with and
  without GPU renderer.
- Fix a nasty memory leak.
- Improve the appearance of translucent tmux
  integration windows on Mojave.
- Fix a bug where left/right-of-screen hotkey
  windows floating over another app's full screen
  window did not go all the way to the top of the
  screen.
- Add usage descriptions so programs running
  within iTerm2 that use the camera, contacts,
  location, the microphone, or contacts can
  request permission to do so.

Other improvements:
-------------------
- Expose English keyboard emulation setting in
  Prefs>Keys. If switching panes/tabs/windows by
  pressing modifier+number stopped working and you
  have a non-English keyboard, go flip the switch
  there.
- Add a setting to toggle subpixel antialiasing in
  Mojave in Prefs>Profiles>Text.
