iTerm2 3.0.8
Bug fixes.

- Fix a bug where iTerm2 would hang if a profile's command terminated quickly,
  or could not be executed.
- When a profile's command can't be executed, print the reason for the failure
  to the session.
- Fix a bug where you could remember the "cancel" action when prompted about
  pasting.
- Make Japanese keyboards produce a backslash when Yen is pressed so long as
  shift is not also pressed.
