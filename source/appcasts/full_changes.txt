iTerm2 version 3.3.6

This build fixes a serious security issue. All
users should upgrade.

The Mozilla Foundation has generously sponsored a
security audit of the iTerm2 source code. As part
of this audit, a problem was discovered which
could cause iTerm2 to issue commands in response
to receiving certain input. This is a serious
security issue because in some circumstances it
could allow an attacker to execute commands on
your machine when you view a file or otherwise
receive input they have crafted in iTerm2.

iterm2-discuss group.

Improvements
- Visual improvements to minimal and compact

  in corporate environments.

Scripting

Version 3.3.5 was short-lived, so its release
notes follow:

-----------------------------------------------------------

This build uses the "hardened runtime", which makes the app
more secure. It is also notarized so it will run on Catalina.

New Features
- You can now import and export key bindings from the
  Presets... menu under the list of key bindings.
- Add an advanced pref to allow paste history to work while
  secure keyboard entry is on.
- New advanced pref to disable bottom line of
  tabbar for low-budget Minimal theme on 10.12 and
  10.13.
- New advanced pref to tweak the initial alpha
  value of flashing indicators, like the bell.
- New advanced pref to escape with quotes instead
  of backslashes for xonsh users.
- Add two new Applescript commands:
  1. invoke API function "f()"
  2. lauch API script with name "scriptname"
  This gives you a bridge to the modern world.
- New window style "Maximized" that is an
  always-maximized window.

Improvements
- Clear the selection when the scroll wheel sends
  an arrow key.
- Improve performance of creating sessions with
  the Python API.
- Update the "xterm" keyboard presets to include
  control+function keys.
- tmux integration will now enable the "Session
  Name" title component by default when using the
  "tmux" profile.
- Double-clicking on a profile in the panel shown when you
  do Shell > Split Horizontally/Vertically... will now split
  with that profile.
- Paste history, command history, and captured output
  toolbelt tools now use a fixed-pitch font.
- Show a warning in Paste History UIs that it is disabled
  when secure keyboard entry is on.
- Don't redraw the whole window every time the mouse moves.
- Update window and tab titles immediately after getting an
  OSC 0, 1, or 2 control sequence.
- Reduce CPU usage for miniaturized windows.
- Add "Stop Coprocess" to context menu.
- Improve reliability of semantic history in
  interactive apps.
- Improve performance of splitting panes with
  Python API.
- Improve git state status bar component's ability
  to detect Xcode license-related issues that
  prevent it from using git.
- Replace "copy profile as JSON" with
  functionality that saves it to a file.
- Visual improvements to Prefs.
- Require user confirmation of downloads over 1
  gb.
- Various security improvements to the Python API:
  - Make it harder for a web browser to connect by
    requiring a special HTTP header.
  - Detect when two processes hold the file
    descriptor to the websocket and deny the
    connection.

Bug Fixes
- Don't open files as URLs when you cmd-click a
  file in a network mount.
- Fix a bug where git commands invoked by clicking
  the git status bar component wouldn't work if
  there was a space in the path to iTerm2.
- Hide a gray line under the title bar that
  occasionally appears in native full screen
  windows with the minimal theme.
- Show the tab color in per-pane title bars.
- Fix a bug where the window shadow would
  disappear after exiting native full screen.
- Sometimes, "show next/previous tab" would appear
  as a grayed out menu item under Window. macOS
  kindly adds this at random for no discernable
  reason. It is no longer grayed out.
- The selection is now cleared on mouse-down.
- The local copy of the profile is no longer
  modified when the cursor shape is changed by a
  control sequence. This fixes a bug where
  splitting a window where the cursor shape had
  been changed caused the new session to have that
  cursor shape.
- Fix a race condition that caused the initial
  directory to sometimes be wrong when creating a
  bunch of new sessions quickly.
- Fix layout bug when resizing triggers window.
- Don't treat force touch as quicklook if disabled in system
  prefs.

  number of cells tall.
- Fix the "broken pipe" divider, which rendered incorrectly.

  it so it can be dragged.
- Fix a bug where the window buttons and window shortcut
  titlebar accessory remained visible after exiting native
  full screen.
- Fix a bug when performing two consecutive searches for
  URLs where the second search had no effect.
- Make text field first responder when opening "send command
  to tmux" window.
- Fix a bug where you couldn't always write to a
  session after creating it in applescript.
- Fix a bug where secure copy drop targets were
  not visible when using the GPU renderer.
- Suport system preference for three-finger tap
  Quicklook.
- Fix incorrect tip of the day about compact
  window style, which was replaced by the compact
  theme.
- Fix rounding error in color picker.
- Fix various memory errors.
- Fix a bug where blinking text didn't redraw
  correctly when scrolled up with legacy renderer.

Scripting
- New APIs for coprocesses.
- Adds a 'title' variable to the tab scope that has the
  tab's actual title.
