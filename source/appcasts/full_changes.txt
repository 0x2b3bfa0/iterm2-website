iTerm2 version 3.3.8

New Features
- Adds a preference to specify whether you want
  each tab to control the window title
  separately, or if all tabs in a window should
  share a single window title. This affects window
  title set by control sequences like OSC 2.
- Separate 'use custom bold color' from 'brighten
  bold colors', which previously were confusingly
  grouped into a single setting.
- Password manager now has a column for user
  names.
- Add support for 2-factor codes appended to
  password in password manager.

Improvements
- Various performance improvements.
- When the window title is changed by a control
  sequence, set the window title to exactly that
  string.
- Remember whether "tags" view of profile list is
  expanded in toolbelt.
- Move selection-related settings into General >
  Selection.
- Add advanced pref to disable tabbar tooltips.
- Set pixel size in TTY.
- Don't show a warning when modifying a session's
  copy of its profile when that profile is backed
  by a dynamic profile.
- When prefs from a remote location fail to load,
  offer to reveal the responsible preference.
- The toolbelt now uses a dark background in the
  Minimal theme when the terminal window's
  background is dark.
- Add Unicode 12 width tables for emoji.
- Add "Edit Account Name" and "Edit User Name" to
  password manager context menu.
- Variable-size tmux windows are now pretty
  usable. Try turning on Prefs>Advanced>Allow
  variable window sizes in tmux integration.
- Put a dot in the close button when there is an
  active job running.
- You can now drag the window using the New Tab +
  button.
- When selecting a tag from the "tags" view, use
  the tag: operator to restrict the search term to
  tags.
- Add advanced pref to enable italic in tmux
  integration. It uses the "screen" terminal where
  the control sequence normally used for italics
  instead does reverse video.

  couldn't log in.

  had the wrong number of columns when first
  created.

  an inactive tab would activate the wrong session
  in that tab.

  showing Profile + Session name caused the
  profile name to go away.

  dashboard.

  entering native full screen.

  without the rest of shell integration, it will
  now work reliably.

  key passpharse input deadlocked. Fix it.
- Preserve the selected weight when changing

- Respect the desired popover size for custom

  correct.

  the very first word in history.

  3.3.7beta3 or later, so keep that in mind when
  distributing scripts.
- Add support for delta updates of the Python
  runtime.
- Add Session.async_get_contents to docs.
- Add Profile.async_get_default and
  PartialProfile.async_get_default.
