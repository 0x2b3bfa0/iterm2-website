iTerm2 version 3.2.6

Bug fixes:

- Improve the tab bar colors.
- Fix a bug where the password manager would
  reveal a password when you switch to another app
  and back while editing the password. The table
  view no longer has the ability to show a
  password; all editing and revealing is done in
  modal alerts to avoid the complexity of table
  views.
- Fix some crashes.
- Improve the appearance of background color
  blending with the GPU renderer.
- Improve appearance of per-pane title bars when
  subpixel antialiasing is on.
- Fix a bug where a window changes screen when
  entering full screen mode.
- Improve disable animations for password manager
  (it didn't always work).
- Fix a bug where the dock would not reappear when 
  exiting non-native full screen mode when the
  appearance is set to dark and the system
  appearance is light.
- Fix a bug where windows didn't have shadows when
  the visual effect view advanced setting was on.
- Fix a crash when saving a window arrangement
  when a pane is maximized.
- Fix rendering of ASCII text with the GPU
  renderer for fonts whose descenders go unusually
  low, like Iosevka Light.
- Fix rendering of images > 256 columns wide with
  GPU renderer.
- Don't resize window vertically when scroller
  style changes.
- Fix mark highlighting in the GPU renderer (the 
  highlight was drawn slightly off vertically).
- Improve the appearance of dragging a tab.
- Fix a bug where blinking text might stop
  blinking.
- Fix a bug where window size would change too 
  much when adjusting font size when there were 
  multiple tabs.

Other improvements:

- Do not use any language but the most preferred
  system language in LANG
- Performance improvements.
- Add emacs to the supported editors for semantic
  history.
- Improve the appearance of the no-man's land
  between panes in tmux integration in some cases.
- Temporarily unmaximize tab while dragging
  another session in to it.
- Improve performance of toggling GPU renderer,
  which will make switching tabs faster.
- Update libssh to version 1.8.
- Improve launch time when using the GPU renderer.
