3.1.beta.8

This is the eighth beta release of the upcoming 3.1 version. If you did not

Bug fixes in beta 7:
- If you change the preferred screen of a profile with a hotkey
  window, it will now take effect immediately (used to have to close
  and re-create the window)

  has a native fullscreen window.

  permission was missing (they now get mapped for
  non-system keystrokes).

  schemes a profile could be the handler for.
