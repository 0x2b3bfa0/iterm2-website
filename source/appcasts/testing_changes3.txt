3.1.2.beta.2

Changes from 3.1.2.beta.1 to 3.1.2.beta.2:

Security update:
The ability to perform DNS requests on hover has been
removed (it was off by dfeault since 3.1.1). It is no longer
an option.

Bug fixes:

  but no hotkey would open when you pressed 'a'
- If you have touch ID, allow the password manager to be
  opened with a password or with touch ID
- Fix issues where curved box-drawing characters didn't line
  up with other box-drawing characters
- Fix a bug where closing an inactive tab from applescript
  instead closed the current tab.
- Fix a bug where native full screen windows restored from
  an arrangement would open on the wrong screen
- Add an advanced pref to remove the status bar icon when
  the app is excluded from the dock
- When the app is excluded from the dock, don't underlap the
  menu bar when in non-native full screen.
- Don't treat halfwidth katakana sound marks as combining
  marks.
- Turn off AquaSKK-compatible key handling by default.
  Multiple users experienced issues where keyboard input
  would break after they pressed a repeating key.
- Fix a bug where tags weren't visible in the profiles list
  in the toolbelt.
- Don't open a window to show a man page if you've
  customized the man page command to a command that ends in
  an ampersand.
- Make the selected tab indicator more subtle when tabs are
  colored.
- Fix a bug where faint text punched a hole through the
  window.
- Fix a bug where the "dark background" or "retina and dark
  background" thin strokes setting caused thin strokes to be
  rendered when the background was light.
- Make the line under the tab bar darker in dark themes.
- Fix various crashes.
- Reduce logging to the system log.



Changes from 3.1.1 to 3.1.2.beta.1:
IMPORTANT SECURITY UPDATE:

- Mitigates a security risk where text in the terminal could
  be exposed by DNS lookups. More info here:

  https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/dnslookupissue

All users should upgrade to 3.1.2.beta.1 or 3.1.2 (stable).

Other changes:
- Built with the 10.13 SDK, so maybe that changes something?
- Restore hotkey windows' screen setting on restore.
- Hopefully fixes a bug where tabs dragged when they
  shouldn't have.
- Performance improvements when there is a long scrollback
  buffer.
- Reorganize a bunch of advanced prefs that used to be
  experimental features into different categories.
- Accept any legal IDN character in a URL you cmd-click on.
- Fix a bug where the cursor type radio buttons overlapped
  the blinking cursor checkbox in prefs.
