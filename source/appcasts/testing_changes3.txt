iTerm2 version 3.3.0beta3

Changes since beta2:

New Features
- Add a new utility, "it2git", which allows the
  git status bar component to show git state on a
  remote host. Install the utilities and then view
  ~/.iterm2/it2git for further instructions.
- Add touch bar mitigations: haptic feedback, key
  click, and blink cursor when touching esc.
- Replace the system font picker with an easier to
  use custom one.
- Performance improvements for long scrollback
  history.

Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug where the tabbar would overlap content
  in native fullscreen for minimal+compact windows
  when adding a second tab while in fullscreen.
- Fix a bug where double tap to open a hotkey
  window didn't function when secure keyboard
  entry was enabled.
- Fix prefs search UI in macOS 10.12 and 10.13.
- Fix a bug when tab dragging is disabled that it
  would still appear to work.
- Remember the next/previous pane navigation order
  of sessions when maximizing/unmaximizing.
- Fix a bug where the app would quit when there's
  only one window and you toggle it to non-native
  fullscreen and confirm to quit is disabled.I
- Fix a bug where the shell was incorrectly
  included as a running process when deciding
  whether you should be prompted to close a
  session.
- Fix a bug where URLs were not properly passed as
  \1 to semantic history commands.
- Fix a bug where the Cocoa app that Apple
  provides to wrap Python was not correctly
  identified as a Python executable, which caused
  excessive permissions prompts when using pyobjc.
- Send SIGWINCH when an API client changes session
  size.
- Fix a bug where double-clicking on the title bar
  of a split pane that's not active would maximize
  the wrong pane.
- Disable websocket ping to avoid timeout
  disconnects.
- Fix a bug where "reveal [script]" appeared in
  open quickly, but tried to run a script named
  "reveal [script]"
- When the window title was changed by a control
  sequence, the window's title would forget the
  title components (e.g., job name). Now it
  replaces the session name with the new window
  name but keeps the other parts. 
- Don't overwrite the 'tty' variable when
  restoring a session.
- Fix a bug where commas weren't accepted as
  decimal points in status bar setup.
- Allow Python scripts to launch even it the
  user's shell doesn't exist.
- Fix a bug where sessions would be stuck after
  exiting copy mode until they received new input.

Other Improvements
- Reduce idle CPU usage when there are many split
  panes.
- Reduce height of minimal+compact tabbar.
- Improve the apperance of the window when
  dragging a tab.
- Improve in-app docs for semantic history.
- Python scripts can now repeatedly try connecting
  to the app if it is not running.
- Move "apps can change title" to the General
  profiles prefs pane to be next to other title
  settings.
- Allow double-click on the area left of the first
  tab in a minimal+compact window to maximize the
  window
- Add an advanced pref to warn about pastes over a
  character limit.
- Allow key mappings to work in copy mode (as long
  as they use the Command key)

Release notes for 3.3.0:

New Features

- A Python scripting API has been added to enable
  extensive configuration and customization. See
  https://iterm2.com/python-api for details.
- A scriptable status bar has been added with 11
  built-in configurable components.
- A new "Minimal" theme has been added to reduce
  visual clutter.
- A new window type of "Compact" combines the tab
  bar and title bar.
- Session, tab, and window titles have been
  revamped to be more flexible and comprehensible.
  You can now configure them separately and select
  what information is shown per profile. They are
  integrated with the new Python scripting API.
- Tabs may now have icons: either an icon
  indicating the running app, or a fixed icon per
  profile.
- The display of Sixel images is now supported.
- Add menu item to arrange split panes evenly. In
  tmux, this uses the tiled layout.
- Greatly improved support for background images:
  they may now span split panes and you can adjust
  how they are scaled to avoid stretching.
- Add support for reporting keystrokes with CSI u.
- New type of trigger added that turns text into a
  hyperlink.
- New type of trigger added that adds annotations
  to the matching text.
- You can now export a recording of your screen
  from the Instant Replay panel.
- A new toolbelt tool, Actions, provides shortcuts
  to frequent actions like sending a snippet of
  text.
- You can now search preferences. There's a search
  bar in the top right of the window.

Other Improvements

- Numerous visual improvements.
- Update app icon.
- You can now change the color preset from the
  Open Quickly window.
- Added an advanced pref for the height of the
  underline cursor.
- The state of various terminal emulation flags is
  now exposed in Session > Terminal State.
- Remove the bell icon from tabs more
  aggressively.
- Various pages of preferences have been
  rearranged to make more sense or be more
  visually pleasing.
- A new menu item lets you configure cmd-+ and
  cmd-- to adjust the underlying profile rather
  than only the current session.
- By default the tab bar now stretches to fill the
  available width so it looks more like a native
  tab bar. You can change this in Prefs >
  Appearance.
- Add a new proprietary control sequence to bounce
  the app icon only one time.
- Add support for setting the proxy icon by
  control sequence.
- Add support for broadcasting passwords to
  multiple sessions from the password manager. Off
  by default.
- Update "Terminal.app Compatibility" key mapping
  for option left and right arrows.
- Add support for natively drawn Powerline glyphs,
  allowing you to use any font and still get the
  fancy arrows. They also align properly with
  other elements, which the Powerline fonts do not
  always do.
- Cmd-clicking on filename[line,column] will now
  open the file to the specified line and column.
- Add "use transparency" as a profile setting for
  newly created windows.
- Adjust how underlines are drawn to have a more
  correct baseline offset.
- Add an advanced pref to swap find next/find
  previous behavior (since the default does not
  conform to macOS norms)

  shortcuts.
- The default scheme for URLs when you cmd-click
  is now https rather than http. You can change it
  with an advanced pref.

  split pane direction in menu items.
- Add an option to preserve window size when tab
  bar shows or hides

  entering a password for secure copy.
