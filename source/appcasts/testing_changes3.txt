The big new feature in iTerm2 version 3.2 is a new rendering
engine that uses Metal 2. It provides much higher drawing
performance. Its availability is subject to some
configuration settings. For details, see
https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/Metal-Renderer.

Changes from 3.2.0beta1 to 3.2.0beta2:

Bug fixes
- Fix a crash when opening prefs on older macOS versions.
- Fix a bug where the triggers panel could not be opened.
- Fix a bug where the prefs panel did not resize when
  toggling use of nonascii font.
- Fix a bug where a floating hotkey window overlapped the
  emoji panel.
- Fix some common crashes on older macOS versions.
- Fix missing underlines on non-retina displays in some
  fonts.
- Fix a bug where Find would never stop wrapping around.
- Fix a bug where Triggers and Find would sometimes not see
  past a double-width character that was wrapped to the next
  line.

Other improvements
- Improve appearance of underlines.
- Triggers and Find now match tabs.

Release notes for 3.2:

New Features
- Metal renderer
- New advanced pref: Open a new window when you click the
  dock icon and no windows are already open?
- New advanced pref: When Focus Follows Mouse is enabled,
  activate the window under the cursor when iTerm2 becomes
  active?
- New advanced pref: Underline Semantic History-selectable
  items under the cursor while holding cmd?
- You can now escape $$ in an Applescript profile command
  with $$$$
- New advanced pref (affecting semantic history's URL
  detection): URLs must contain a scheme?
- Show inline images in retina resolution. On by default in
  beta. In release, enable advanced pref "Show inline images
  at Retina resolution".
- There is a new key binding action to toggle mouse
  reporting.
- Semantic history now recognizes visual studio code-style
  "filename[line, column]" references.
- There's a new type of trigger that turns text into a
   hyperlink.

Bug Fixes
- When you drag a session onto itself in a window with split
  panes, do not move the window.
- Don't allow fullscreen or edge-attached windows to be
  moved with cmd-opt-shift-drag.
- Fix the color picker's eyedropper feature to respect color
  spaces.
- If multiple hotkey windows are open, do not return to the
  previously active app when one is closed.
- When changing the number of lines of scrollback, do not
  apply the change until focus leaves the text field. This
  solves a problem where erasing the value would erase your
  history.
- Scrolling with wheel mice is no longer oversensitive.
- Change behavior of prompt-before-closing for tmux
  integration. Since the list of jobs is not visible, always
  prompt when a whitelist of jobs is specified.
- Fix a bug where changing the cursor shape by escape
  sequence could be reverted by changing any profile
  property.
- When the password manager fails to get a password because
  the system Keychain denied access, show an alert
  explaining what happened.
- Ignore modifier+number when there's no matching
  pane/tab/window to switch to rather than passing it to the
  terminal as a keypress.
- Fix a bug where cmd-0 did not restore the original font
  size in tmux integration.
- Ignore malformed OSC 11.
- Fixes a bug where images could be drawn in the wrong
  column.
- Improved behavior of Yen key sending backslash for
  Japanese keyboards.
- "Select Current Command" works while the command
   is running
- Fix a bug where the offer to turn off paste bracketing
  didn't actually turn off paste bracketing.

Other improvements
- When not in alternate screen mode, tab will change the
  background color of cells the cursor skipped over. This
  violates tradition but is more sensible behavior for
  printing syntax-highlighted code with tabs.
- Inset marks by one pixel on the left margin.
- The rendering of faint text has been changed to take the
  background color into account.
- The toolbelt tools look nicer in the dark schemes.
- The pointing hand cursor will show only while over a
  clickable item while holding cmd.
- Tab name truncation no longer takes a parenthesized (job)
  name at the end into account when deciding whether to
  truncate the head or tail.
- Performance improvements.
