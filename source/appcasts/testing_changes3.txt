  screen when scroll wheel is in send-arrow-keys-in-alt-screen mode.

  completions.

  shortcut to toggle a profile window.

  schemes a profile could be the handler for.
- Fix a bug where you couldn't assign a keystroke to open a saved
  arrangement as tabs.


3.1.beta.5

This is the fifth beta release of the upcoming 3.1 version. If you
did not receive an earlier 3.1 beta, please see the section on "New
features in the 3.1 track" below.

  when in tmux integration.

  window caused the new window to appear in the wrong place.

  * Use the touch bar to select tabs in full screen
  * Assign labels to function keys with a shell script

  * Hotkey windows can be made to float over other apps' fullscreen windows.

  different "id"s will not highlight together on hover. id is
