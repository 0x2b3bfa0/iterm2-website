iTerm2 3.2.7beta4

- Improve the UI when prompting for full disk
  access to remind you of the steps after opening
  system prefs.

- Fix a crash on first launch when Safari hasn't
  been run yet.

- When you drag a session over a tab with a
  maximized pane, don't cause any panes to get
  SIGWINCH.

- Change how the secure keyboard input menu item
  works: Selecting it now toggles whether iTerm2
  *wants* secure keyboard entry to be on. Before,
  it would consider whether other apps had it on,
  which was just confusing. Now it shows a
  checkmark when it is on because iTerm2 wants it
  on, a hyphen when iTerm2 wants it off but it is
  on anyway, and no mark when it is actually off.
