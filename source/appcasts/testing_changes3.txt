iTerm2 version 3.3.5beta1

Improvements
- Clear the selection when the scroll wheel sends
  an arrow key.
- Improve performance of creating sessions with
  the Python API.
- Update the "xterm" keyboard presets to include
  control+function keys.
- tmux integration will now enable the "Session
  Name" title component by default when using the
  "tmux" profile.

Bug fixes
- Don't open files as URLs when you cmd-click a
  file in a network mount.
- Fix a bug where git commands invoked by clicking
  the git status bar component wouldn't work if
  there was a space in the path to iTerm2.
- Hide a gray line under the title bar that
  occasionally appears in native full screen
  windows with the minimal theme.
- Show the tab color in per-pane title bars.
- Fix a bug where the window shadow would
  disappear after exiting native full screen.
- Sometimes, "show next/previous tab" would appear
  as a grayed out menu item under Window. macOS
  kindly adds this at random for no discernable
  reason. It is no longer grayed out.
- The selection is now cleared on mouse-down.
- The local copy of the profile is no longer
  modified when the cursor shape is changed by a
  control sequence. This fixes a bug where
  splitting a window where the cursor shape had
  been changed caused the new session to have that
  cursor shape.
- Fix a race condition that caused the initial
  directory to sometimes be wrong when creating a
  bunch of new sessions quickly.
