iTerm2 version 3.3.0beta13

Improvements
- Allow Highlight triggers with "Instant" enabled
  to fire more than once per line.
- Add a profile preference to disable paste
  bracketing.
- Keep the git status bar component from using
  gobs of CPU and memory when you have an enormous
  repo.
- Visual improvements window border.
- Allow hotkey window to overlap the dock.
- When semantic history is configured to run a
  command and the command fails, you can now see
  the output.
- In tmux integration if a window's title is empty
  show the active session's name in the tab.
- Add an option to log Automatic Profile Switching
  messages to the scripting console.

Bug Fixes
- The Python API can now split a session that has
  terminated.
- Fix various CSI u bugs.
- Fix bugs where the cursor was in the wrong place
  after restoring a session.
- Fix a bug where downloading multiple files by
  scp would fail.
- Fix a bug where the hotkey window could overlap
  the menu bar.
- Fix crashes.
- Fix a bug where you couldn't add multiple status
  bar components in Catalina.
- Fix a bug where the font picker would have too
  large a right inset when legacy scrollbars are
  in use.
- Fix a bug where the initial working directory
  wasn't detected until you pressed a key.
- Fix a bug where the wrong command got added to
  command history when you use tab completion in
  tcsh.
- Fix a bug when switching from regular to compact
  or minimal in a window with at least two tabs
  where the titlebar gets stuck on.

Things Made Worse
- The shorcut for "Zoom" (making a window fill the
  screen) changed to Cmd-Shift-0. macOS forces it
  to take this value on some machines. Better to
  be consistent. Sorry for breaking your workflow.
  I blame Apple.

Release notes for 3.3.0:

New Features

- A Python scripting API has been added to enable
  extensive configuration and customization. See
  https://iterm2.com/python-api for details.

  built-in configurable components.

  revamped to be more flexible and comprehensible.
  You can now configure them separately and select

  integrated with the new Python scripting API.
- Tabs may now have icons: either an icon
  indicating the running app, or a fixed icon per
  profile.
- The display of Sixel images is now supported.
- Add menu item to arrange split panes evenly. In
  tmux, this uses the tiled layout.

- New type of trigger added that turns text into a
  hyperlink.
- New type of trigger added that adds annotations
  to the matching text.
- You can now export a recording of your screen
  from the Instant Replay panel.

  to frequent actions like sending a snippet of
  text.
- You can now search preferences. There's a search
  bar in the top right of the window.

  git status bar component to show git state on a
  remote host. Install the utilities and then view
  ~/.iterm2/it2git for further instructions.
- Add touch bar mitigations: haptic feedback, key
  click, and blink cursor when touching esc.
- Replace the system font picker with an easier to
  use custom one.
- Search now remembers your 10 most recent queries
  and offers them as suggestions.

  rearranged to make more sense or be more
  visually pleasing.
- A new menu item lets you configure cmd-+ and
  cmd-- to adjust the underlying profile rather
  than only the current session.

  Appearance.
- Add a new proprietary control sequence to bounce
  the app icon only one time.

  control sequence.

  open the file to the specified line and column.
