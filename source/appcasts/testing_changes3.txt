iTerm2 version 3.2.6beta1

Bug fixes:

- Fix a bug where the password manager would
  reveal a password when you switch to another app
  and back while editing the password. The table
  view no longer has the ability to show a
  password; all editing and revealing is done in
  modal alerts to avoid the complexity of table
  views.
- Improve the tab bar colors.
- Fix some crashes.
- Improve the appearance of background color
  blending with the GPU renderer.
- Improve appearance of per-pane title bars when
  subpixel antialiasing is on.
- Fix a bug where a window changes screen when
  entering full screen mode.
- Improve disable animations for password manager
  (it didn't always work).

Other improvements:

- Do not use any language but the most preferred
  system language in LANG
- Add emacs to the supported editors for semantic
  history.
- Improve the appearance of the no-man's land
  between panes in tmux integration in some cases.
- Temporarily unmaximize tab while dragging
  another session in to it.
