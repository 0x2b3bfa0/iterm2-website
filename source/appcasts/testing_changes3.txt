iTerm2 version 3.3.0beta5

Improvements

- Simplify themes. Before, you could choose to use
  the Minimal theme with the Normal window style,
  but it looked terrible. Minimal looks good with
  the Compact window style. Users were also
  confused because the theme and window style are
  tightly coupled visually but distant in prefs.
  In this version, the compact window style is
  gone. By selecting the Minimal theme, Normal
  windows are automatically compact. The
  "Automatic" theme has been renamed to "Regular",
  and in this theme the Normal window style has a
  title bar. A new theme, "Compact" has been added
  which does away with the title bar but otherwise
  looks more like a standard macOS app than does
  Minimal.
- Prevent repeated Print control sequences from
  locking up a session.
- Do not draw the area left of the first tab as
  part of the first tab.
- In minimal or compact theme, when the tabbar is
  on top or bottom and tabs stretch to fit width
  and you have one tab and you drag the tab and
  drop it outside any window, move the window
  instead of destroying the old one and creating a
  new one at the new location, which had the
  annoying side-effect of forgetting the Use
  Transparency setting.
- Allow fractional point sizes with new font
  picker.
- When restoring a window from an arrangement, try
  to put windows fully on-screen. This is useful
  if you have changed your displays since saving
  the arrangement.

Bug Fixes

- Fixes a problem on macOS 10.12 where sessions
  would terminate immediately after opening.
- Preserve both the prompt and a partially entered
  command when clearing the screen.
- Fix a bug where a window's title bar could
  become transparent.
- Fix a bug where the title bar could have the
  wrong color.
- Fixes a bug where the full screen tab bar could
  be inset on the left.
- Fixes crash on cmd-click to invoke smart
  selection action.
- Fixes various crashes.
- Fix a bug where advanced initial working
  directory prefs had the wrong defaults.
- Fix a bug where using a session immediately
  after creating it in AppleScript would have no
  effect.

  click, and blink cursor when touching esc.

  use custom one.

  visually pleasing.
- A new menu item lets you configure cmd-+ and
  cmd-- to adjust the underlying profile rather

  control sequence.

  always do.

  open the file to the specified line and column.
- Add "use transparency" as a profile setting for
