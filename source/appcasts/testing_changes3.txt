3.3.10beta1

Security Improvements
- The security model for the Python API has changed. Any
  process attempting to use the API that was not launched by
  iTerm2 will require explicit user approval.

  The previous technique, which relied on inferring the job
  name from its command line, could be subverted.

  Consequently, the UI for authorizing particular scripts
  has been removed.
