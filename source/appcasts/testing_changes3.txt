iTerm2 version 3.3.7beta4

New Features
- Adds a preference to specify whether you want
  each tab to control the window title
  separately, or if all tabs in a window should
  share a single window title. This affects window
  title set by control sequences like OSC 2.

Improvements
- Add support for 2-factor codes appended to
  password in password manager.
- When the window title is changed by a control
  sequence, set the window title to exactly that
  string.
- Put a dot in the close button when there is an
  active job running.
- You can now drag the window using the New Tab +
  button.
- Performance improvements.

Bug Fixes
- Preserve the selected weight when changing
  typeface, when possible.
- Respect the desired popover size for custom
  status bar components. This fix may cause some
  popovers to have different-sized popovers than
  expected, and may require updating the script to
  correct.
- Fix a bug where Find Next would not navigate to
  the very first word in history.
- Fix a runaway CPU issue when initializing GPU
  renderer.
- Touch bar in full screen now shows correct tab
  titles. Fixes a bug where they would get out of
  sync with reality.
- Fixes a bug where adding a new password in the
  password manager could hang.
- Fixes a bug introduced in the previous beta
  where minimal-theme title bars were the wrong
  color and window borders sometimes didn't appear.

Scripting
- Add Session.async_get_contents to docs.
- Add Profile.async_get_default and
  PartialProfile.async_get_default.
