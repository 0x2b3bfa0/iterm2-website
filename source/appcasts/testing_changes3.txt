iTerm2 version 3.3.4beta1

New Features
- There's a new pref for whether you want to
  be asked to confirm quitting the app when there
  are no windows.

Improvements
- Infer current job name (for status bar, title
  bar, etc.) when using tmux integration locally.
- Append to automatic log output files by default,
  instead of replacing them.
- Search history is no longer opened by default
  when you type in a Find field. Press the down
  arrow to see your recent searches.
- Control sequences that set the window or icon
  title now cause that title to become visible.
- Preserve the exact dimensions of sixel images
  when possible.
- Translate italc to reverse video in tmux
  integration.
- The git status bar component now truncates long
  branch names instead of disappearing because
  it's too big to fit.
- Python API scripts are now run through the
  user's shell so they'll have the right PATH,
  in case they want to spawn subprocesses.
- Use dark appearance for scrollbars in minimal
  theme when the terminal background color is
  dark.
- When you create a tab with the Python API,
  iTerm2 will no longer get activated
  automatically.
- Add "disable status bar" to the status bar
  context menu.

Bug fixes
- Fix a 16-year-old bug: if you make a selection,
  switch apps, copy to the pasteboard, and then
  click in the terminal window the selected text
  in the terminal window got copied to the
  pasteboard causing you to lose what had been
  copied from the other app.
- Fix many crashes.
- Fix a bug where two custom status bar components
  or title providers could not run concurrently if
  their callbacks had the same signature.
- Fix a regression where control-| stopped sending
  control-backslash on Japenese keyboards.
- Fix flickering job name when using tmux
  integration locally.
- Show a context menu when right clicking on the
  titlebar in minimal or compact mode when there
  is no tab bar.
- Fix colors of graph-based status bar components
  in dark mode.
- Fix a crash when a shell integration-reported
  hostname has a leading dot or two consecutive
  dots in its name.
- Use the right color for the window shortcut
  number in minimal theme when the first tab is
  colored.
- Fix various rendering bugs with inline images in
  both the GPU and legacy renderers.
- Fix a bug where popping an icon or window title
  from the stack didn't always work.
- Fix a bug that caused hotkey windows to
  immediately hide after showing when two of them
  had the same shortcut.
- Fix GPU rendering of ASCII text when the font
  includes glyphs that spill outside their bounds
  to the left, like AnonymousPro.
- When stealing key focus is enabled, make the
  session that's receiving stolen keys first
  responder.
- Fix a bug where the cursor was advanced one
  position more than it should have been after
  showing an image.
- Fix a bug where resizing panes by the Window >
  Resize Split Pane menu items would not always
  work if the panes had different fonts.
- Don't expose the existence of the placeholder
  status bar component (used in empty status bars)
  in the context menu.
