iTerm2 version 3.2.4beta1

- Hide window shadow for windows with transparent
  sessions in the current tab on Mojave. Apple
  broke transparent windows so this workaround is
  necessary for acceptable performance.
- Fix how LANG is computed on Mojave. Apple broke
  locales.
- Fix viewing PDFs on Mojave with imgcat. This one
  isn't Apple's fault!
- Improve performance when blinking text is
  enabled (even if none is visible).
