New Features

  integrated with the new Python scripting API.
- Tabs may now have icons: either an icon
  indicating the running app, or a fixed icon per
  profile.
- The display of Sixel images is now supported.

- New type of trigger added that turns text into a
  hyperlink.

  bar in the top right of the window.

  click, and blink cursor when touching esc.

  use custom one.
