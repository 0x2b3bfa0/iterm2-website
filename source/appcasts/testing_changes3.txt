iTerm2 version 3.2.3beta1

Continued improvements to Mojave support.

Bug fixes:
----------
- Fix support for subpixel antialiasing on Mojave.
  Previously, if you had enabled this hidden OS
  feature, text would be very hard to read.
- Improve the appearance of translucent tmux
  integration windows on Mojave.
- Change how "thin strokes" works on Mojave. The
  concept only applies to subpixel antialiasing.
  You can either choose to turn on subpixel
  antialiasing (and adjust stroke thickness) or
  leave it off and live without.
- Fix a bug where left/right-of-screen hotkey
  windows floating over another app's full screen
  window did not go all the way to the top of the
  screen.
- Add usage descriptions so programs running
  within iTerm2 that use the camera, contacts,
  location, the microphone, or contacts can
  request permission to do so.

Other improvements:
-------------------
- Expose English keyboard emulation setting in
  Prefs>Keys. If switching panes/tabs/windows by
  pressing modifier+number stopped working and you
  have a non-English keyboard, go flip the switch
  there.
