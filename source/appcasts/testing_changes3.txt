iTerm2 version 3.3.8beta2

New Features
- You can now create session logs in plain text.
- A new built-in color preset has been added.

Improvements
- Set quarantine flag on downloaded files.
- Rewrite firmlink paths from shell integration to
  their shorter version.
- Add an advanced pref to revert Consolas
  rendering to its pre-3.3.8beta1 algorithm.
- Combine the Log>Start and Log>Stop menu items.
- Color presets are now previewed on highlight.
- .its files (signed script archives) now sign the
  entire file rather than only the payload. Legacy
  files can still be imported for now.
- Require user permission for some control
  sequences:
  - StealFocus control sequence
  - DECRQCRA
  - ReportVariable
  - File download
- Disable quicklook for URLs that are not http or
  https.
- When viewing a list of menu items (such as when
  adding a key binding) the items in the profiles
  menu now indicate if they create a new tab or
  window.
- Navigating between marks and annotations by
  keyboard has been changed. The previous
  shortcut, cmd-shift-up/down now navigates only
  marks. Cmd-shift-opt-up/down now navigates
  annotations.
- When three-finger drag is configured to make a
  selection that is now reported as a mouse drag.

Bug Fixes

  loses keyboard focus.
- Fix various bugs with three-finger drag to
  select.
- Don't hang when importing an .its file with a
  self-signed cert.
- Fix bug where git status bar component would
  unnecessarily truncate its contents.

  positions would sometimes shift down upon
  attaching.

- Directories with non-initial tildes in their
  names now work properly with the git status bar
  component.

  Catalina. This was Apple's fault.

Things Made Worse

  worked very well.
