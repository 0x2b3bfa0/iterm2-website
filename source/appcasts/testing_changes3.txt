iTerm2 version 3.3.8beta1

New Features
- New status bar component that shows a menu of
  Actions.
- If you don't want to use the default shell and
  use a custom command to launch your shell,
  there's a new option called "custom shell" that
  will launch it as a proper login shell.
- Copy mode now supports W and B to move forward
  or backward the way vim does with W and B.

Improvements
- The Actions tool now allows multiple selection
  and reordering.
- Actions defined in the Actions tool now show up
  in Open Quickly.
- Speed up Open Quickly window animation.
- Shortcuts in Open Quickly no longer require a
  space. For example, you can now type /axyz to
  restore an arrangement named "xyz".
- Search history is now stored in a separate
  preferences database for better privacy.
- Change how font metrics are computed for
  Consolas, which only looks good when values are
  rounded in a particular way.
- Duplicate Tab now respects the advanced pref
  that opens a new tab adjacent to the curren tab.
- If default-terminal is set to something other
  than screen then tmux integration won't
  translate italic to reverse video.
