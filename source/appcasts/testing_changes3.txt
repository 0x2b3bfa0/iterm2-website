iTerm2 version 3.2.7beta1

Bug fixes:
- Fix funny behavior of the text field where you
  enter the number of lines of scrollback history.
- Fix a bug where the GPU renderer wasn't used
  when there was a maximized pane.
- Fix a bug when exiting tmux integration mode
  with a buried gateway session in a hotkey
  window. It no longer forgets it is a hotkey
  window.
- Ensure the session title background and the
  title bar have the same color when navigating
  among split panes.
- Accept surrogate pairs as keyboard input so you
  can use the Unicode Hex Input keyboard to enter
  codes from supplemental planes.
- Fix a bug where the gpu renderer didn't use
  minimum contrast if the preceding character was
  a box drawing character
- Fix the appearance of non-antialiased Pragmata
  Pro when subpixel antialiasing is off on macOS
  10.14.
- Fix a bug where control+page up/down would move
  the wrong scrollview when there are split
  panes.
- Fix a bug where the "you must restart" alert
  shown when you toggle discrete GPU was not
  dismissable.

Other improvements:
- Add code to validate a faster scrollback history
  algorithm.
- Support filename(line, column) for semantic history.
- Remember the setting of "use transparency" when
  restoring a window.
