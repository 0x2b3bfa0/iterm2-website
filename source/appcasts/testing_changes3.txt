iTerm2 version 3.3.2beta1

Improvements
- Keep the "current directory" status bar
  component up to date in tmux integration.
- Add setting to control whether the native or
  tmux status bar is used in tmux integration
  mode.
- Adds a "number" variable to the window scope.
- Show the tab title or tmux window name in the
  Open Quickly UI when it difers from the session
  name.
- Add an advanced pref to tweak the size of the
  window dragging area in minimal and compact
  windows.
- Don't offer to reset paste bracketing/mouse
  mode when the username changes but the hostname
  does not.
- Changes to the status bar are now applied
  immediately. Cancel undoes them.

Bug fixes
- Fix a bug where automatic log files had the
  wrong tab number in the filename.
- Fix a bug where exiting full screen after
  changing the theme could leave some junk behind
  where the title bar was.
- Python scripts that set a variable without
  changing its value will no longer raise an
  exception.
- Fix a bug where the window size after exiting
  non-native full screen was different than before
  entering it.
- Fix a bug where a non-native fullscreen window
  didn't go all the way to the top of the screen.
- Update the session "path" variable when the
  working directory is updated (when shell
  integration is not installed).
- Fix a bug where a window could not be made full
  screen twice when native full screen is enabled
  and the app is excluded from the dock.
