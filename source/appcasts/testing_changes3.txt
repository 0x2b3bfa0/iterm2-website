iTerm2 2.9.20160422
Lots of bug fixes and some teeny new features. Release notes now include the
SHA-256 of the zip file.

Updates:
- Update libssh to version 1.7 to fix a crash when public key authentication
  fails.
- Update to the latest version of Sparkle, version 1.14.

Major bug fixes:
- Fix a memory leak.
- Fix a crash when changing the number of displays.
- Fix a crash when there is no general pasteboard.
- Improve performance when a tmux window has a lot of tabs.
- Setting the background image via an escape sequence is now disabled when the
  terminal is marked untrusted in advanced prefs.
- Make the scure input menu item indicate the true state of secure input, even
  if another app has turned it on.
- Remember the width that the tab bar was dragged to when it's on the left.

New Features:
- Add regular expression substitution to the advanced paste window.
- Offer to install utilities (currently imgcat and it2dl, which downloads
  files) when you install shell integration.
- Add a new custom escape sequence. OSC 1337 ; ReportCellSize ST will respond
  with OSC 1337 ; ReportCellSize= H ; W ST where H and W are floating point
  values giving the height and width of a cell, respectively.
- Parse /etc/auto_master to find NFS automounts and ignore them for semantic
  history because they tend to be slow to statfs().
- Add Select Current Command to the Edit menu. It selects the command at the
  current command line. It requires that Shell Integration be installed.
- Set TERM_SESSION_ID and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION for compatibility with
  Terminal.app's standard.

Improvements to Automatic Profile Switching:
- Fix a bug where Automatic Profile Switching rules were scored incorrectly.
  Longer rules now outrank shorter rules ceteris paribus, as they always should
  have.
- Add support for "sticky" Automatic Profile Switching rules. A sticky rule
  begins with ! and will stay in effect after its rules no longer match
(provided no other APS rule matches).
- Add support for wildcards in path names in Automatic Profile Switching rules.

Visual Improvements:
- Modernize the look of the Open Quickly window.
- Improve the visual appearance of inactive tabs with colors.
- Left-align tab labels when the tab bar is on the left.

  always opaque.

  history.

  Buffer is selected.

  when iTerm2 is not the active app.

  been renamed in Get Info.
- Improve how the bold version of your font is chosen.
- Fix a bug where non-anti-aliased underlines were too thick.
- Change how the view is redrawn. It now redraws 30 times per second when
  active. Previously it did some really complicated, poorly understood, and
  probably buggy things with adaptive rates.
- Fix a bug where the hamburger menu's Restart Session item would restart the
  tab's current session, not the session associated with the menu.
- Improve signal handling for shells without job control by making the session
  retoration server a process group leader.
- Fix a bug where trying to tmux -CC attach to a tmux server without a session
  would cause us to write a command to the shell prompt.
- Fix a bug where the activity indicator in a tab wouldn't appear with a dark
  theme, sometimes.
- Reduce CPU usage in certain cases by not drawing tab labels and computing
  their sizes excessively.
- Improve predictability of restoring the default window arrangement.
- Fix a bug where user names were not properly escaped as an argument to login.

  keyboard would move it by two sometimes.
- Fix a bug in how selected text is reported to accessibility.
- Fix a bug where option-click to move the cursor didn't handle double-width
  characters properly.
- Fix a bug where an unterminated DCS code would cause output to be consumed
  indefinitely. Now we stop when we get a control character besides ESC or
  non-ASCII text.

  in a directory other than your home directory would not respect hushlogin.
- Improve the appearance of top-right indicators when timestamps are being
  drawn.

  is resized with bash.
- Improve the visual appearance of marks, especially with larger fonts.
- Highlight marks in red when they have an error code when navigating to them.
- Make the confirmation click prompt to disable tip of the day more noticeable.


iTerm2 2.9.20160313
tl;dr: Lots of bugs fixed. Significant changes to automatic profile swiitching.
Miscellaneous small new features added.

Major Changes:
- Change how Automatic Profile Switching to keep a stack of profiles. When no
  APS rule is matches the current state, we pop profiles from the stack until it
  has only one or we find one whose rule matches.
- Update to libssh2 version 1.7.0. Fixes a bug where known_hosts entries got
  clobbered and adds new algorithms.

New Prefs:
- Add an advanced setting to disable escape sequences that could be misused by
  untrusted content. Issue 4229.
- Add a new advanced setting to control how many bytes of context are used in
  semantic history. Issue 4399.

Updates to Semantic History:
- Treat IP addresses and hostnames with at least two components as URLs for
  semantic history. Issue 4281.
- When opening a file from semantic history, if no app is able to handle opening
  the file offer the user the option to pick an app and associate it as the
  default viewer. Issue 4281.
- Strip enclosing parentheses, angle brackets, square brackets, apostrophes, and
  quotes from filenames in sementic history (used to be just parens).

Other Improvements:
- Left-side tab bar can now be dragged wider or narrower. Issue 4270.

  targets' username, hostname, and destination directory.

  strip the trailing newline.
- Rename the trigger action 'Set Directory' and 'Set Host and User' to reduce
  confusion. Allow 'Report Host and User' to report only the host ("@hostname")
  or only the user ("username@").
- Replace \n and \xXX in the badge with newline and an ascii value.
- Add a "Don't Ask Again" option to the offer to restart a session.

  button that takes you to the wiki article explaining how to fix it.
- If you enter a query beginning with "/a", "/f", "/p", or "/t" in the Open
  Quickly window then results are restricted to window arrangements, searching
  sessions, switching profiles, and opening tabs, respectively.
- Automatically detect when you're tryiing to use the scroll wheel to move
  through a document in alternate screen mode and offer to change the setting.
- Add support for a custom CSI code: CSI 1337 n. We'll report a string of 'CSI
  ITERM2 versionnumber n'. This is useful for detecting that iTerm2 version 3 is
  running in a way that's compatible with other terminals.

Big Bugs Fixed:

  well) composed of more than one ideograph didn't select the full word on
  double click. Issue 4325.
