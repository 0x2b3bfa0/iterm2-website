2020-05-15: Fix a bug where the dock would appear over a
nonnative fullscreen window because we aren't able to tell
which screen has the dock when our presentation options
cause the dock to be hidden; consequently, we believed the
dock was not on the same screen as a fullscren window, and
we changed the presentation option back to show it. The hack
used herein is to remember the last screen that had the dock
and assume it hasn't moved. That ought to mostly work,
unless the user does something devious like move the dock to
another screen where it is also not visible.

pyobjc when not necessary"

2020-05-07: Send arrow keys for scroll wheel when in soft
alternate screen mode

2020-05-07: Remove unordered_map from iTermColorMap and turn
it back into obj-c. There were a number of double-frees
while destroying the unordered map. I don't see how I'm
misusing it, but if I had a nickel for every time c++
shivved me in the back I'd still hate the sob

2020-05-05: Suppress short-lived session warning if closing
because of detach

2020-05-04: Fix crash where a divorced session had a profile
whose GUID was in shared, not sessions ProfileModel.

The repro steps are: 1. Create a new window 2. Cmd-+ to
increase font size 3. Split vertically 4. Edit font in
shared profile to make it smaller 5. Cmd-+ in the new
session again. Crash.

The reason was that when we split vertically we preserved
the GUID and Original Guid, but forgot to copy
_overriddenFields from the session being split to the new
session. Consequently, when the underlying profile was
updated in step 4 the GUID didn't appear to be overridden
and the shared GUID overwrote it. The session continued to
have divorced flag set to YES. Next time you change its font
size it checks if it needs a divorce and discovers its
profile is not in sessions instance.

2020-05-04: Fix handling of empty install_requires in

2020-05-03: Add more debug logging around font creation for
issue 8862

2020-05-03: For inscrutable reasons, fullscreen windows
aren't added to the Window menu when the theme is minimal or
compact. Apple's long-archived "documentation" on this at
https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/WinPanel/Tasks/UsingWindowsMenu.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000231-BCIBJBDA
says:

  This menu automatically lists windows that have a title
  bar and are resizable and that can become the main window

However this is a lie because fullscreen windows don't have
a titlebar and aren't resizable regardless of theme, yet
some of them are listed in the Window menu.

By pure luck, they gave us an API to work around this
brokenness, and it's actually easy to use!

2020-05-03: Don't change selection when renaming an account
in pw manager

2020-05-02: Allow tmux windows to hang around after
detaching if the tmux profile is not configured to close

2020-04-19: Show a message while resizing indicating if any
of the windows dimensions are fixed. Give maximized windows
the resizable flag so this is visible. An attempt to reduce
the confusion seen in issue 8809.

2020-04-19: Prevent resizing full-width x-of-screen windows.
I think that's more sensible than making them snap back to
their original size

quickly that gives their command, user@host, directory, or
badge. Use the most informative of those by looking at which
has the most distinct values. Issue 8829

2020-04-17: Don't call broken pipe when failing to connect
to the server. Instead call it when you do connect to the
server but the child is unknown (which I don't think will
happen normally, but I guess it could happen if the state
restoration gets confused because there were 2 instances of
the app running and you have a bogus pid in the arrangement)

2020-04-17: Check euid of attaching process to unix domain
socket

2020-04-17: Add applescript-based auth module

2020-04-16: Fix autoresizing mask for border views

2020-04-16: Refactor multiserver to allow larger messages
and play nice with streams (no zero length messages, add
message length header to all messages, make hello regular).
Also make more stuff async; use dispatch_sources to wait for
reads and writes to be ready. The server blocks on reads and
writes so the client must not block or it can deadlock.
There are still bugs. I need to bump the protocol version
and I need to debug the asan issue I get in the server on
parser failure

2020-04-16: Remove outdated comment since

space changes. windowDidBecomeKey: happens too early and the
presentation controller thinks the window is not on the
current space. Issue 8815

2020-04-05: Work around one of the weirder quirks of macOS.
NSScrollView tries to outsmart you when you put a view over
a scroller, but it forgets that the most important part of
outsmarting someone is not being dumb. It proceeds to
trigger bugs and crazytimes. See the snarky comment for
details.
