2019-01-23: [python] Bump verison

2019-01-23: [python] Remove stray single quotes. Issue 6764,
comment from 1/23

2019-01-23: When a tmux window opens, do not set the local
window's origin unless it's the first tab in the window.
Issue 7484

2019-01-23: Fix double counting of division view when laying
out the root terminal view with a hidden top tab bar. This
caused tmux window sizes to become unstable. The root cause
of this bug which I keep hitting is that the client size is
based on the tabview's height divided by the height of a
cell; we then set the window's height to accommodate a
tabview that will fit that height in cells. When those two
cacluations are not inverses it becomes unstable. In this
instance the instability was that the root terminal view was
setting the tabview height one point smaller than it should
have been for the window height. That is possible because
the calculations are relatively distant. The root terminal
view, in its rather complicated layout method, calculates
tabview height as a function of window height. The inverse
calculation, 'f(tabview height)->window height', is done in
PTYTab.tmuxSize. It is further complicated by the fact that
tmuxSize is a mind-bendingly complex algorithm because it
has to deal with split panes. I don't see a sane way to put
these two functions next to each other, unfortunately. It
would be nice to add some tests, but even that is a hairy
mess because of all the dependencies on NSWindow and
NSScrollBar that would need to be injected. At least I'll
have this commit message to jog my memory next time... Issue

2019-01-23: [statusbar] Disable jobs component popover in
10.13 because it looks bad. The text views and disclosure
triangles have a 50% alpha gray background. It looks like a
compositing bug to me because modifying the textfield's
alpha value does not fade it out but hiding the textfield
hides the background. And besides it is also on the
disclosure triangles so even if I beat the textfield into
submission I'd also have to make my own disclosure triangle
and honestly just F it Apple gives me nothing and I'm tired
of fighting

2019-01-23: Prevent the open quickly window from tricking
focus follows mouse into closing itself when it shrinks
while the mouse was over it

2019-01-23: Improve status bar popovers for 10.13

color.

2019-01-21: Fix a bug where compact windows could be dragged
under the menu bar. Issue 7108

2019-01-21: Make badge position configurable in UI.

variable spacers in setup UI depending on layout algorithm

2019-01-20: Fix a warning

2019-01-20: Fix a bug where theroot terminal view would
layout incorrectly when the tab bar was hidden and the
division view was visible. The division view's height was
not accounted for and the top decoration height was used
where it should've been the bottom. Cocoa's upside down
coordinate system will never stop causing bugs.

2019-01-20: Refactor the status bar view controller a bit
and simplify things. Fix a bug where status bar background
colors weren't drawn to the edge

2019-01-20: [statusbar] Allow fixed width spacers to specify

2019-01-19: [statusbar] Refactor layout algorithm into its

popover with a tree of running jobs.

2019-01-19: Merge branch 'master' of

may have changed. Fixes a bug where a permanent status bar

workers. Each takes a separate shard of paths so that if one
hangs others have a chance to work on non-network file
systems. Also don't update them when not visible, but do
update immediately when one becomes visible.

coordinates the various cold-launch activities to avoid
spamming the user too much.

Fixes a bunch of bugs with status bar colors and full screen
layout bugs.

2019-01-11: [api] Fix pip3's shebang when installing a
full-environment script so deps are only added to the folder
for the script, not globally

2019-01-11: Allow the mouse to move up to three points

2019-01-08: Make secure keyboard entry menu item more sane.

1. Selecting it toggles whether iTerm2 wants secure keyboard
entry.  2. The menu item shows a "mixed" state if it's on
but we don't desired it to be on. Presumably if we desired
it on then it's on, so no need for a mixed state there.

Issue 2078.

2019-01-08: Avoid needless NSUserDefaults calls that are
quite slow in cadence controller delegate

2019-01-08: [cherrypick from 3.2] Add a CPU profiler to
track down issues like 7421

2019-01-08: [cherrypick from 3.2 of 2 commits] Enable
fastpath underlines in the legacy renderer. Issue 7437

After years of frustration I finally figured this one out!
It was trying not to set the font on the graphics context if
the font hasn't changed becaues it's slow. That was wrong
because the *context* changed, which is why the alpha mask
wasn't getting drawn into. This absolutely sucked to debug
both this time and in 2014, mostly because the CG APIs are
such a bloody mess of state and implicit dependencies.

2019-01-08: [cherrypick from 3.2] Refactor underline drawing
code so it makes sense

2019-01-05: Expand nonterminals in path suggestions. Improve
how referenced variables are tracked to always be relative

anything.

the ladybug, then offer to move it to autolaunch if doing so

I have a feeling there is a memory leak in here somewhere
because it should have been evaluated again.

2018-12-22: Update the session title in setProfile rather
than setPreferencesFromAddressBookProfile because the
profile is sometimes set after that and the session title
provider goes through a delegate and therefore needs the
_profile to be up to date. fixes a bug where setting the
session title seemed to have no effect.

2018-12-15: Do not attempt to render a metal frame if there
is no context. Better to spin the CPU a bit than to assert.
Still not an ideal situation, but I haven't been able to
reproduce the cause of nil contexts. I did see a crash due
to this. My guess is funny things happen when waking from
sleep, so it should only be a temporary problem.

2018-12-15: Add a check for overrun after postprocessing
character bitmap

2018-12-15: Fix warnings from ancient code. A new type was
added that caused confusion about the type of the selector
session. Objective C is scary.

invisible because another one in the same tab is maximized.
Issue 7410

2018-12-13: Refuse to open the password manager when a probe
is active. A password manager trigger can fire while probing
and it gets all confused. Issue 7401.

2018-12-13: Fix color of "Shell integration must be
installed to use this feature" label. Was set to black,
broke in 10.14 dark mode. Issue 7419. Change by Ryan

by 5062f7f7337ac8c3ecdf68c6fe3cbff26446821f. Issue 7416.

2018-12-13: Fix a bug where wrappedStringAt:... did not
produce coords in 1:1 correspondence with codes in the
returned string when there were combining marks. Issue 7415.

2018-12-13: [api. python] Add async_close to tab, window,
and session. Issue 7414.

2018-12-11: [semantic history] Add support for [line,column]
suffix. Issue 7398

2018-12-11: When semantic history matches a file test to see
if the next chunks would give a column/line number. That's
necessary because of the (x, y) suffix support since chunks
split on parens. Issue 7398

2018-12-11: [semantic history] Accept file(line,column)
without a space after the period. Issue 7398

2018-12-11: [python, api] Update keyboard interfaces.

Filtering is now a distinct subscription from keyboard
monitoring. It does not send notifications. This allows you
to filter separately from monitoring.

All the keyboard code is now in the same python file.

The examples are updated.

window cycle by default. Issue 7374

2018-12-09: Fix a bug where 'you must restart' alert shown
when toggling integrated/discrete GPU can't be dismissed.

2018-12-09: Don't scroll on control+page up/down in
performKeyEquivalent: if the receiver is not the first
responder. I don't know why macOS routes this event to a
view that isn't in the responder chain. Issue 7407

2018-12-09: Turn on font smoothing for non-antialiased text.
Fixes a bug in rendering PragmataPro on macOS 10.14. Issue
7394

transparency setting in the window's arrangement. Issue 7390

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Improve logging for event
taps

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Support filename(line,
column) for semantic history. Issue 7378

2018-12-09: Accept surrogate pairs as keyboard input. Issue
7337

2018-12-09: Ensure the session titlebar background and label
have the same color. Issue 7368

2018-12-09: When detaching from tmux and the gateway session
is automatically buried, restore it before closing the other
tmux tabs. This fixes a bug where it would forget it was a
hotkey window. Issue 7384.

2018-12-09: Fix a bug where the GPU renderer was never used
when a split pane was maximized.

2018-12-09: Run line buffer fast-vs-slow path sanity tests
1% of the time. Otherwise use only the slow path. Fix a
failing unit tests.

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Refactor a bunch of code
to help implement delta updates in metal. Add a per-line
generation that uniquely identifies it. Move per-frame state
into its own file.

2018-12-09: Tolerate illegal characters in integer profile
files (like scrollback lines) because they'll be removed
when editing ends

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] When reloading a profile,
wait until all sessions have updated their copy of the
profile before resizing the window to fit the new session
size. This fixes a bug where a window with multiple tabs
would shrink too much when reducing the font size. It would
shrink for the first tab, and then again for the second, and
so on. By having all sessions' fonts up to date before doing
fitWindowToTab, all sessions whose font sizes changed in
concert will request the same size.

2018-12-09: Change NSLog to DLog

2018-12-09: Synchronize creation of ASCII textures so you
don't create more than one of the same concurrently.
Synchronize access to shared ASCII texture cache (oops!).

2018-12-09: Update NMSSH to the latest version of my fork,
including libssh 1.8 and openssl 1.1.1. At commit

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Fix a bug where
wrappedLinesFromIndex:width:count: would return an empty
array when the index equaled the start of a block other than
the first. Issue 7323

2018-12-09: Avoid calling
iTermUpdateCadenceController.description

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Add a fast path for
frequently accessed user defaults keys that sacrifices
thread safety for better speed on the main thread only

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Disable metal while a tab
drag is in progress so that its snapshot may be taken. Also,
fix a bug where we'd keep retrying to create a graphics
context for sessions without windows (such as those
belonging to non-current tabs) once a second. Not having a
window now causes metalAllowed: to return NO.

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Fix frames of dragged tabs
and windows

2018-12-09: Fix frame of dragged tab (as long as it doesn't
leave the tab bar)

2018-12-09: When the window size changes because scroller
appearance changed, preserve its height and adjust only the
width. Issue 7318 and 6198.

2018-12-09: Rename _scrollerStyleChanged and
refreshTmuxLayoutsAndWindow to make sense. Add comments and
logging.

Add the hack from commit be6ca89 to the GPU renderer. Issue
7316

words, characters that draw excessively low. Issue 7299.

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Fix a bug where saving an
arrangement with a maximized pane also saves its contents.
Issue 7003. Also fix a bug where VT100Screen did not strip
NSNulls properly from its content. AFAICT this never gets
turned into a plist but it is poor form.

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Cache and re-use ASCII
textures to reduce time taken to switch tabs

2018-12-09: Log bounding boxes of characters to debug log

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Fix missing tabbar in
10.13

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] When exiting traditional
full screen mode show the menu bar after updating the
window's style mask. Changing the style mask causess
refreshTerminal: to be called, and that changes the
dock/menubar visibility. Issue 7300

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Refactor toggle
traditional full screen mode code

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Move all calls to
setHasShadow: to one method. Gives shadows to windows
without a title bar. Do not give shadows to full screen
windows (that logic was kind of there before but not done
consistently). See comment in issue 2057

2018-12-09: For compact+minimal: update colors when
switching panes and use good label colors in session title
views.

2018-12-09: Draw the background color on tab title labels
because macOS can't composite views correctly when subpixel
AA is on in Mojave. Issue 7176

2018-12-08: Add session>log>save contents. Issue 7404

2018-12-08: [python] bump version

2018-12-05: [python] Add movetab example

2018-12-05: [python] Fix a race condition where python would
send an request registering an RPC, iTerm2 would ack it and
immediately perform the RPC. The local registration happened
after the response was handled, but the RPC call beat it in
the race. This commit registers the RPC locally before
sending the request (which may or may not succeed). If the
request fails, it then unregisters it. This leaves the
script in a bit of a funny place while waiting for the
response. The RPC is registered from Python's POV but not
necessarily iTerm2's. I think this is safe, though. The
script reasonably expects the RPC to be called. The worst
case is there's some race and it gets called before it's
officially registered, but that would be a bug in iTerm2.
Issue 7232.

2018-12-05: Fix a bug where the gpu renderer didn't use
minimum contrast if the preceding character was a box
drawing character (or wrongly did use it when a box drawing
characters follows a non-boxdrawing character)

2018-12-05: Oops, forgot to include the code for the
previous commit.

2018-12-05: Add support for natively drawn powerline glyphs.
This fixes two annoying things: minimum contrast is not
applied to native box drawing glyphs, so now the powerline
arrows look right next to the solid background color when
minimum contrast is in use and; when you have extra vertical
spacing everything lines up properly. Issue 7372.

2018-12-05: Clean up prefs>keys. Make options in select
lists consistent and right align navigation shortcut labels

2018-12-05: [python] Add movetab example

2018-12-04: [api] Update cadence was not respected for
rpc-provided status bar components. Issue 7382.

2018-12-04: Refactor broadcast sessions to move most of the
code into a helper. Sessions are now tracked by their GUIDs
rather than by their views' IDs which can change when a view
is dragged. Issue 7381

2018-12-03: Remove window appearance when theme changes to
minimal. Issue 7370

2018-12-03: Fix the tab context menu in native full screen
in Mojave. Issue 7366. Mouse coordintaes were a lie when
gotten with mouseLocationOutsideOfEventStream. I have no
idea why this weird method was used. Also, the responder
chain is broken in this case, so just specify the target
directly.

2018-12-03: Only write out two parts of the Python version
in setup.py. We don't want to pin to dot releases

2018-12-03: Fix a bug where creating full environment
scripts failed because the directory was not created.
Improve logging when linking the environment in this case.

2018-12-03: Do not try to download a python runtime when
launching a full environment script. When launching a basic
script, if the python version specified only has one part
(e.g., python3) ignore it and use the latest.

2018-12-03: Ensure stanard window buttons in compact windows
have targets. Issue 7360

2018-12-02: [python] Add escindicator example

2018-12-01: [python] Add colorhost example

2018-12-01: Fix a retain cycle between iTermVariables.owner
and PTYSession that had the awful side effect of keeping
MTKView alive and drawing infinitely fast for
incomprehensible reasons (aside from MTKView being a
steaming ). Issue 7369

2018-12-01: [api] Freeze scripts at their initial Python
version forever.

My experience going from 3.6.5 to 3.7.0 was that backward
compatibility is going to be a serious problem for user
scripts. I don't want things to just break, so instead let's
keep scripts at their initial python version forever. This
seems to be keeping in the spirit of having a squillion
versions of Python installed because nobody wants to
maintain software because software is terrible. I'm sorry
for making it worse.

Details:

ARCify NSFileManager+iTerm

Respect python version in setup.py.

For basic scripts, change shebang to give 2-part python
version. When running a basic script, use that version.

If a particular python version is needed but is not present
download the newest runtime that includes it.

Change semantics of runtimes in the app support directory.
iterm2env is the latest, iterm2env-N is runtime version N,
and iterm2env-X.Y is python version X.Y (latest downloaded
bugfix) and iterm2env-X.Y.Z is python version X.Y.Z. They
are trees of hard links so they can survive deletion of each
other as upgrades happen.

When installing a python runtime for a full environment
script create hard links, don't unzip. This saves disk
space. This means the zip files don't need to be saved (so
they are not saved)

Write out setup.py files for full environment scripts
including python_requires='=x.y.z'. Scripts will be frozen
at their initial python version to avoid nasty surprises
when upgrading.

Update the basic script templates to specify Python 3.7.
I'll need to keep these up to date as new versions of Python
come out.
