2019-08-21: Disable 'set title by control sequence' when
title components don't allow the effect to be visible. Issue
8145

2019-08-21: Poll for working directory if insecure escape
sequences are disabled. Issue 8144

2019-08-21: Fix the tag on 'erase search history' to avoid
showing a checkmark when case-insenstiive regex is selected.
Issue 8143

2019-08-21: Ensure left-side tabbar is wide enough for
buttons and window number in compact and minimal. Issue
7988, in the comments.

2019-08-21: Add icons for Elixir and Erlang

2019-08-21: More process icons

2019-08-21: Add some process names for Redis and PostgreSQL

2019-08-21: Specify preferences section

This message confused me a bit the first time as it wasn't
obvious which section of Preferences this would be on. This
would make it easier for anyone to find it.  2019-08-21:
Send encoded files for it2ul really fast. Add an advanced
pref to disable this. Issue 8142

2019-08-19: Avoid changing window type after exiting lion
fullscreen if unnecessary. When changing window type, remove
the contet view from its old superview before setting it as
the content view of the new window because macOS just can't
seem to do anything right (you get a visual effect view
covering everything, and it's a subview of the NSThemeView).
Issue 7988

2019-08-19: Add the option to abbreviate the hostname when
on localhost. Issue 7705

2019-08-19: Make flashing tabbar overlap content and hide
its backing when on top. Issue 8130

2019-08-18: Add better logging to track down assertion in
divorcing a session where its profile has disappeared.

2019-08-18: Fix an out-of-bounds read. I'm not quite sure
how to reproduce it, but I can tell from the crash logs and
disassembly that it read of the end of one of the _datas
byte arrays.

The crash report with the smoking gun was
1565202147.246087595. It performed a read at offset 0xa003,
which was past the end of a buffer of size 0xa000. This
could happen if there was a fractional size or the canvas
size doesn't match the _size. I don't know the root cause,
but at least this should stem the bleeding.

2019-08-18: Don't crash if the font picker returns nil for
one of the fonts. Not sure why that would happen, though.
Fixes a common crash.

2019-08-18: Update BetterFontPicker.framework

2019-08-18: Add more BFP user data to gitignore

2019-08-18: Remove user data

2019-08-18: Don't use force unwrapping. I'm not sure why
this was crashing (presumably nil) but just reload the table
and return if things are nutty.

2019-08-18: Update description of advanced pref
URLCharacterSet to include file names and instructions to
restart.

2019-08-18: Allow top-of-screen windows to overlap the
titlebar. Issue 8132.

2019-08-18: Fix how the coordinates in AddHiddenAnnotation
are bounded. There was a bug where they were bounded by the
cursor position, not the bottom right of the screen. Issue
8111

2019-08-17: Make dark high-contrast more visible by default
and add an advanced pref to make it pretty. Issue 7563

2019-08-17: Replace control characters in titles with
caret+letter instead of question mark. Issue 8124

2019-08-15: Ensure secure keyboard entry is turned on when
app launches. Before it would not happen until the menu
validated or the app became active.

2019-08-15: Fix a bug where secure keyborad entry
incorrectly used the Search History user default preference.
Includes a migration path to preserve settings from the
buggy time.

2019-08-15: Change default title components to Job. I don't
know why it was set to session name, and previous that
profile name. Setting it to Job fixes the migration from
3.2, where that was the default behavior. Also, job is just
more useful than profile name which for many people is just
"Default". Issue 8115

2019-08-15: Fix escaping of control characters in JSON
strings. Issue 6764 (@yacn's comments)

2019-08-15: Allow moving tmux windows between sessions by
holding option/command (#391)

The tmux dashboard allows linking windows between different
sessions via drag-and-drop. This change modifies that
behaviour, such that if option or cmd are pressed during the
drag, the window will be moved instead of linked.

2019-08-14: Don't create app support symlink if the advanced
pref is set to empty string

2019-08-14: Change how URLs in smart selection actions are
escaped to be less broken. It's still kinda broken. Issue
8088. See issue 8119 for the task to unbreak this mess in
general

2019-08-14: Don't try to CFRelease null

2019-08-14: Replace the call to CGContextSelectFont with
CGContextSetFont. Turns out it works fine and is much
faster. Issue 8105

2019-08-14: Don't loan tabbar to titlebar accessory when
it's configured to flash. Issue 8112.

I considered a lot of options:

1. When flashing, remove from title bar accessory and add to
root terminal view controller. Rejected because you might
show the title bar during a flash. Also, really freaking
complicated.  2. Reveal the title bar and tab bar instead of
the old flash animation. Rejected because it does not appear
to be possible. Even if it were, it's too tall.  3. Create a
copy of the tab bar and flash that. I like this the best,
except the complexity is absolutely astounding. No way.  4.
Disable flashing for non-native tab bars. Rejected because
it doesn't make any sense for users. Breaks existing
workflows.  5. Don't loan the tabbar to the titlebar
accessory vc if flashing is enabled. This basically gets us
back to the pre-3.3.0 behavior.  6. Just show an image
instead of a real tab bar. I tried this, but it was also
pretty complex. It will inevitably have a lot of problems
because it's not the real thing, snapshots are flaky,
accessibility will probably be an issue, etc.

2019-08-13: Disable metal after creating an annotation

2019-08-13: Don't return a hidden tab bar control from
hitTest:. Fixes a bug where double-clicking the window
shortcut label when there's a fake window title label didn't
work. Issue 8110

2019-08-12: Fix Applescript 'tell session to set name to x'.
Commit 8393a4e57 tried and failed. Setting the
autoNameFormat is not resilient because it often gets
overwritten with the session's profile name, such as when
you open Edit Session. I don't see any reason why
Applescript should be different than modifying the session
name in Edit Session. See Lorenzo's comments in issue 7621

2019-08-12: Apply
https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/pull/368 to libssh2 to
test the fix to escaping tildes in file paths

2019-08-12: Show a dialog after not installing the python
runtime because you already have it. Happens if you install
after deleting the symlink and relaunching

2019-08-12: Make the name of the ApplicationSupport symlink
configurable. Issue 6746

2019-08-11: Adjust left inset of stoplight buttons to match
the top inset. Affects compact theme and Minimal theme when
tab height is adjusted downwards. Issue 8046.

2019-08-11: Add status bar icon to docs

2019-08-11: [python] Bump version

2019-08-11: Don't forceFrame if the frame is on the first
screen

2019-08-09: Eliminiate uses of half and half4 in favor of
float and float4. Word on the street is that most GPUs don't
support half. More importantly, the Metal compiler s with
halfs and doesn't with floats. See issue 7941

2019-08-09: Set window collection behavior when replacing
the window at runtime. Issue 8100

2019-08-09: Work around a macOS bug where windows jump to
the main screen after you replace the window controller's
window.

2019-08-09: When entering traditional fullscreen don't
auto-hide the dock if the dock is on a different display
than the window. Issue 8096.

2019-08-09: Automatically convert drag of a tab into a
window drag when: 1) the theme is compact or minimal, and 2)
the tab bar is visible, and 3) there is only one tab. Issue
8080

2019-08-09: Fix a bug where the status bar icon's tint color
was set incorrectly in updateIconIfNeeded (didn't take the
text color into account). Issue 8097

2019-08-08: Remove the corner radius from the window size
view because Visual Effect Views don't work right over a
semi-transparent window.

2019-08-08: Create a temporary status bar find driver when a
session needs but does not have one. Happens after moving a
session into a split pane when it has a temporary find
field. Issue 8084

2019-08-08: Ensure the cursor is below the 'session
restored' banner.

2019-08-08: Don't try to micromanage the composer popover's
appearance pre-10.14. Caused white-on-white text. Not sure
the underlying cause and not important in this case. I don't
trust appearance stuff on 10.13. Issue 8076

2019-08-08: Allow git state cache entries to live for 10
seconds. After they reach 2 seconds of age, they'll be used
only if the command runner fails. Issue 8075

2019-08-08: Don't use black for the flexible view color. The
status bar makes it really ugly. I hope to eliminate the
flexible view soon, anyway. Issue 8074

2019-08-08: Restrict before & after text passed to semantic
history command to the logical window, since it is used when
choosing the text that was clicked on. Issue 8073

2019-08-08: Force session views to redraw when their window
becomes/resigns key to make the title view's background and
title view label's background match. Issue 8063

2019-08-07: Make dark high contrast look good on 10.13 and
10.14. Issue 7563

2019-08-07: Increase size of status bar setup window so you
can see all the components at once

2019-08-07: Don't use non-ascii font for non-ascii underline
descriptor if the non-ascii font is off. Issue 8068

2019-08-07: Fix a bug in the tutorial

2019-08-07: Add back support for telnet: urls with ports.
Reported by email

2019-08-07: Initialize username and hostname variables with
92694USER92694 and 92694HOST92694.

2019-08-07: When a session is initializing, update its
profile with its name after performing $$ substitution.
Issue 8058.

2019-08-07: Better logging for title function

2019-08-07: More tweaks to dark high contrast tabs

2019-08-07: Update how local directories are computed. When
we update because of a window title change, update the path
variable. When the pwd poller gets a directory, update a
mark. Generally simplify this horrid mess. Issue 8038.

2019-08-07: Don't use the tab color as the status bar
background color in minimal theme (when per-pane status bars
are turned off).

2019-08-07: Don't order in hotkey window when restoring it
from an arrangement. Issue 8051

2019-08-06: [python] Add Window.window_number. Issue 4899

2019-08-06: Style fixes

2019-08-06: Reset the collection behavior when exiting lion
full screen in LSUIElement mode. Issue 8048

2019-08-06: Set termID just before computing the autolog
filename. Do not set it early before the tab number is
known. The tab number is not known until the session's tab
is added to a window. Trying to catch it at just the right
moment is very hard, but it should be safe to defer doing
until we are ready to fetch the autolog filename because
that happens before the job is launched. Issue 8053

2019-08-06: Apply changes to status bar immediately. The OK
button now dismisses with no action and the cancel button
reverts changes. Issue 8054

2019-08-05: Add a comment relating the vm_stat command line
app to the struct

2019-08-05: Improve PromptMonitor to inform you when a
command starts and ends.

2019-08-05: Update cls to include example that clears the
current tab only, by Dmitry Koterov

2019-08-05: Update 'path' variable when we poll a working
directory. Issue 8038

2019-08-05: Remove accidental newline

2019-08-05: Only offer to reset terminal when hostname
changes, not user name. Issue 8030

2019-08-05: Set window type after calling
replaceWindowWithWindowOfType. Fixes a bug where traditional
fullscreen windows didn't go all the way to the top of the
screen

2019-08-05: Fix a bug where the window size after exiting
traditional fullscreen wasn't the same size as before
entering fullscreen. Issue 8027

2019-08-05: Fix a bug where advanced pref text values were
not visible. CHERRY PICK INTO 3.1.1

2019-08-05: Add advanced pref to increase space between

not return an error.

2019-08-05: Add disk space status bar example

move the test shell script into tests

2019-08-05: Fix failing tests

no title bar.

2019-08-05: Add support for C1 control codes.

2019-08-05: Show bezels in text fields in advanced prefs.
Issue 8003

2019-08-05: Fix the badge preview. The sizes used were all
wrong. Also indicate the the margins are in points in the
UI.

2019-08-05: Fix autoresizing mask of font picker in badge
config window

2019-08-05: Ensure the badge label size is correct when the
badge renderer asks for it while updating a profile. Issue
8006

2019-08-05: Don't crash when badge height set to 0. Issue
8007

2019-08-05: Improve wording of advanced pref for tabbar
height in minimal

2019-08-05: Prevent setContentView: from being called
re-entrantly when setting the window type causes the
effective appearance to change. Issue 7995

2019-08-05: Add a command runner pool to manage command
runner lifecycles for the git poll worker. This is an
attempt to fix the flakiness of the git status bar
component. Issue 7705

2019-08-05: Fix some docstrings because there's an enum for
the initial working directory

2019-08-05: Activate the app before showing a modal
sheet/alert. This doesn't cover all of the many modal alerts
because it's just too much to test right after a release. It
fixes issue 7977 - opening the set tab title panel in a
floating hotkey window when another app is active causes the
window to disappear.

2019-08-05: Fix docstrings for other set variables calls

2019-08-05: Fix a bug where opening the open quickly window
would hide the hotkey window

2019-08-05: Make floating panel hotkey windows overlap the
menu bar. Issue 7984

2019-08-05: Fix a bug where closing a native fullscreen
window would cause a new window to be created. Issue 7987

2019-08-05: Change wording of setting to choose beta
channel. Issue 7989

2019-08-05: 3.3.0

release_beta.

Fix docstring for session.async_set_variable to mention that
it must begin with `user.` 2019-07-31: Improve git component
logging

2019-07-31: After exiting lion full screen, replace the
window with one of the right type. Fixes a bug where
changing from regular to minimal theme while in full screen
leaves you with a broken window after exiting full screen

2019-07-31: Don't prompt fish users about paste bracketing
because fish turns it on before the prompt. Issue 7968

2019-07-30: Add an advanced pref to disable osc 8
underlining. Issue 7969

URL or nil params

2019-07-28: Ensure the scripts folder exists before
attempting to install a script

2019-07-28: Update SignedArchive project and main.m. This
should've been in 44d8a296

2019-07-28: Add re-signed .its files for tutorial

2019-07-28: Update signatures of tutorial .its files because
their certs had expired. Add a 'resign' tool to
SignedArchive to make this easy to do.

2019-07-28: Update window style variable when fullscreen
changes

2019-07-27: Show tmux window title in window title when
available. See discussion in issue 6938

2019-07-27: Don't let the search field become first
responder while inside -[NSWindow makeKeyAndOrderFont:]. The
recents menu may be opened as a consequence of it becoming
first responder. That causes macOS to  its britches and the
window doesn't become visible. Issue 7965

2019-07-27: Change floating hot windows max level to be just
under the menu bar. Issue 7963

2019-07-24: Use visual effect views behind popups

2019-07-24: Make notes tool monospace

2019-07-24: Disable rich text in paste special preview. Use
Menlo.

2019-07-24: Fix various minor bugs in Python API docs

2019-07-23: Restore a lot more of the screen state (e.g.,
marks) that was previously not restored for reasons that are
unclear. Ensure the cursor appears after the session
restoration banner.

2019-07-21: 3.3.0beta15

2019-07-21: Add fs-only-status-bar example

2019-07-21: Bump python version

2019-07-21: [python, api] Improvements to subscriptions

- Make it possible to subscribe to variable change
notifications from all windows.  - Fix some python
docstrings that referred to Badges docs for info on
variables.  - Make it possible to use a VariableMonitor for
all windows.  - Add Window.async_get_variable - Fix a bug
where full screen windows didn't get
iTermDidCreateTerminalWindowNotification posted. This
prevented layout change notifications for new windows whose
style was full screen.

2019-07-21: Don't call titlebarAccessoryViewControllers on
non-titled windows because it asserts >:(. Issue 7956

2019-07-20: Fix support for full-height cursor in GPU
renderer

2019-07-20: Make GPU renderer use the proper height for the
vertical bar cursor when there is vertical spacing

2019-07-20: Fix position of frame cursor in GPU renderer to
be consistent with block cursor.

2019-07-20: Fix vertical alignment of images in GPU
renderer. The bottom margin was double counted

2019-07-20: Fix vertical alignment of box-drawing characters
when vertical spacing is enabled. Issue 7932

2019-07-20: Fix text color of advanced prefs in 10.14

2019-07-20: Expose window style through the "style" variable
in the window scope. Legal values are:

"normal"; "non-native full screen"; "native full screen";
"full-width top"; "full-width bottom"; "full-height left";
"full-height right"; "bottom"; "top"; "left"; "right";
"no-title-bar"; "compact"; "accessory";

Expose window frame as a 4-element array in variables. A
dictionary would be better but I don't want to add syntax
for dictionaries now.

2019-07-20: 3.3.0beta14

2019-07-18: Fix a bug when switching from regular to compact
or minimal in a window with at least two tabs where the
titlebar gets stuck on.

2019-07-18: Make APS switcher's delegate weak

2019-07-18: [python] Remove stray print statement

2019-07-18: Improve APS logging

2019-07-18: Improve APS logging

2019-07-18: Add option to save APS logs to script console.
Issue 7953

2019-07-18: Reset inCommand when we get FTCS A. The only
case where it would go YES->NO is when the last-received
code was B, meaning the user was entering a command when a
new prompt came along. I can make this happen in tcsh by
using tab completion when ambiguous to show options. I
tested basic functionality in bash, zsh, and fish and
everything seemed to work with regualr use, aborted
commands, and ambiguous tab completion. Issue 7954

2019-07-18: Fix a bug where you couldn't close all tabs in a
fullscreen window with cmd-shift-w

2019-07-16: Allow polling for working directory up to once a
second until the initial value is determined

2019-07-16: Update BetterFontPicker.framework

2019-07-16: [BFP] Don't use contentSizeForFrameSize because
when legacy scrollbars are enabled it uses them even when
you give it a nil verticalScrollerClass.

2019-07-16: Prevent a crash when finding the range of a word
when there's a complex character whose lookup fails.

2019-07-16: Don't crash if a function call status bar
component has a nil label

2019-07-16: Don't crash on non-UTF8 encoded commands when
getting process name/args

2019-07-14: Fix bug where you couldn't add multiple status
bar items in Catalina. Issue 7875

2019-07-13: Keep the git status bar component from eating
all resources. Limit it to 4 megs of memory, 2 seconds of
CPU time, and run it at the lowest possible priority. When
it fails, erase the content of the status bar component to
avoid showing stale info

2019-07-13: Fix semantic history test

2019-07-10: Allow instant highlight triggers to fire more
than once per line. Issue 7934

2019-07-08: If a tmux window's title is empty, show the
active session's name in the tab.

Don't crash when the user erases a tmux session's tab title
override in edit session prefs.

Fix how validating nil arguments in built-in function method
calls works.

2019-07-08: Reduce the level of floating hotkey windows so
they don't overlap the menu bar. Issue 7924

2019-07-08: Change the keyboard shortcut for zoom to
cmd-shift-0. macOS seems to really want it to be this value.
On some machines, it's forced to be although it doesn't seem
to be tied to a particular OS version. It's annoying to have
shortcuts change, but it's even worse if they differ from
machine to machine for no reason. See issue 7894.

2019-07-03: Send CSI 32;2u for shift+space in CSI u mode.
Issue 7911

2019-07-02: Make it possible to view the output from a
semantic history command when it exits with a nonzero return
code. Issue 7915

2019-07-02: Don't attempt to connect to the ssh agent if you
have a predecessor, who already did it. Seems to be a bug in
NMSSH that calling connectToAgent a second time hangs
