leaves you with a broken window after exiting full screen

page

2019-07-28: Prevent a crash when showing the semantic

2019-07-28: Add re-signed .its files for tutorial

changes

2019-07-27: Show tmux window title in window title when
available. See discussion in issue 6938

2019-07-27: Don't let the search field become first
responder while inside -[NSWindow makeKeyAndOrderFont:]. The
recents menu may be opened as a consequence of it becoming
first responder. That causes macOS to  its britches and the
window doesn't become visible. Issue 7965

2019-07-27: Change floating hot windows max level to be just
under the menu bar. Issue 7963

2019-07-24: Use visual effect views behind popups

unclear. Ensure the cursor appears after the session
restoration banner.

2019-07-21: 3.3.0beta15

2019-07-21: Add fs-only-status-bar example

2019-07-21: Bump python version

2019-07-21: [python, api] Improvements to subscriptions

- Make it possible to subscribe to variable change
notifications from all windows.  - Fix some python
docstrings that referred to Badges docs for info on
variables.  - Make it possible to use a VariableMonitor for
all windows.  - Add Window.async_get_variable - Fix a bug
where full screen windows didn't get
iTermDidCreateTerminalWindowNotification posted. This
prevented layout change notifications for new windows whose
style was full screen.

2019-07-21: Don't call titlebarAccessoryViewControllers on
non-titled windows because it asserts >:(. Issue 7956

2019-07-20: Fix support for full-height cursor in GPU
renderer

vertical bar cursor when there is vertical spacing

be consistent with block cursor.

2019-07-20: Fix vertical alignment of images in GPU
renderer. The bottom margin was double counted

when vertical spacing is enabled. Issue 7932

2019-07-20: Fix text color of advanced prefs in 10.14

2019-07-20: Expose window style through the "style" variable
in the window scope. Legal values are:

"normal"; "non-native full screen"; "native full screen";
"full-width top"; "full-width bottom"; "full-height left";
"full-height right"; "bottom"; "top"; "left"; "right";
"no-title-bar"; "compact"; "accessory";

Expose window frame as a 4-element array in variables. A
dictionary would be better but I don't want to add syntax
for dictionaries now.

2019-07-20: 3.3.0beta14

2019-07-18: Fix a bug when switching from regular to compact
or minimal in a window with at least two tabs where the
titlebar gets stuck on.

2019-07-18: Improve APS logging

2019-07-18: Add option to save APS logs to script console.
Issue 7953

2019-07-18: Reset inCommand when we get FTCS A. The only
case where it would go YES->NO is when the last-received
code was B, meaning the user was entering a command when a
new prompt came along. I can make this happen in tcsh by
using tab completion when ambiguous to show options. I
tested basic functionality in bash, zsh, and fish and
everything seemed to work with regualr use, aborted
commands, and ambiguous tab completion. Issue 7954

2019-07-18: Fix a bug where you couldn't close all tabs in a
fullscreen window with cmd-shift-w

2019-07-16: Allow polling for working directory up to once a
second until the initial value is determined

2019-07-16: Update BetterFontPicker.framework

2019-07-16: [BFP] Don't use contentSizeForFrameSize because
when legacy scrollbars are enabled it uses them even when
you give it a nil verticalScrollerClass.

2019-07-16: Prevent a crash when finding the range of a word
when there's a complex character whose lookup fails.

2019-07-16: Don't crash if a function call status bar
component has a nil label

2019-07-16: Don't crash on non-UTF8 encoded commands when
getting process name/args

2019-07-14: Fix bug where you couldn't add multiple status
bar items in Catalina. Issue 7875

2019-07-13: Keep the git status bar component from eating
all resources. Limit it to 4 megs of memory, 2 seconds of
CPU time, and run it at the lowest possible priority. When
it fails, erase the content of the status bar component to
avoid showing stale info

2019-07-13: Fix semantic history test

2019-07-10: Allow instant highlight triggers to fire more
than once per line. Issue 7934

2019-07-08: If a tmux window's title is empty, show the
active session's name in the tab.

override in edit session prefs.

Fix how validating nil arguments in built-in function method
calls works.

2019-07-08: Reduce the level of floating hotkey windows so
they don't overlap the menu bar. Issue 7924

2019-07-08: Change the keyboard shortcut for zoom to
cmd-shift-0. macOS seems to really want it to be this value.
On some machines, it's forced to be although it doesn't seem
to be tied to a particular OS version. It's annoying to have
shortcuts change, but it's even worse if they differ from
machine to machine for no reason. See issue 7894.

2019-07-03: Send CSI 32;2u for shift+space in CSI u mode.
Issue 7911

2019-07-02: Make it possible to view the output from a
semantic history command when it exits with a nonzero return
code. Issue 7915

2019-07-02: Don't attempt to connect to the ssh agent if you
have a predecessor, who already did it. Seems to be a bug in
NMSSH that calling connectToAgent a second time hangs
