day when I have unlimited free time I will revisit this.

2019-04-26: In minimal or compact theme, when tabbar is on
top or bottom and tabs stretch to fit width and you have one
tab and you drag the tab and drop it outside any window,
move the window instead of destroying the old one and
creating a new one at the new location. Issue 7747

selection action

2019-04-26: Guard some NSLogs

2019-04-25: Remove compact window style. Add compact theme,
instead. Improve the ability to change window style at
runtime. Theme and window style are now intertwined: the
window style that is actually used is a function of the
theme and the profile's window style. Minimal and Compact
themes rewrite normal window style to compact, while all
other themes rewrite compact to normal. Issue 7744

2019-04-24: Add a workaround for websockets.connect() timing

for a second or so after being created

2019-04-21: Remove debug=YES

2019-04-21: Remove synchronous process cache method in favor
of aggregating completion blocks and notifying requesters
asynchronously. The first time a session asks for its job's
name and there is a process ID, this gets used. It informs
the session at the earliest possible time what the job name
is.

2019-04-21: Fix a modify during enumeration bug. I wasn't
able to figure out where the enumeration is, but this is
safer at least

2019-04-21: Fix a bug where PTYSession would leak if closed

error logs can be written to the proper history entry.  -
Logs an error to script console when trying to set a profile
property with the wrong type.  - Define font and nonascii
font as strings so they can be set by scripts.

2019-04-20: Remove NSLog

2019-04-20: Add validity checks to texture pages to catch
memory corruption

avoid blocking the main thread when creating a new session

10.12

2019-04-18: Make semantic history and URLAction construction
asynchronous. Move filesystem poking into its own thread to
avoid wedging the main thread when we encounter a network
filesystem.

- ARCify iTermURLActionFactory - Make iTermURLActionFactory
async - Make users of URLActionFactory async - ARCify some
PTYTextView code. Put it in its own category since ARCifying
this whole thing at once is too much - Make open target
async - Move updateCursor into ARC and make it async - Move
handle drag of semantic history item into ARC and make
async. Also fix a bug with pasting a file where it would do
multiple pastes, some of which might prompt for permission -
Move quicklook to ARC - Remove the last vestiges of
URLAction from PTYTextView.m - Do semantic history in
separate threads.  - Cache whether files exist for up to 10
seconds to make semantic history faster - Use interpolated
strings in semantic history instead of a gross hack. Make
openPath: async. ARCify iTermSemanticHistoryController -
Evaluate autolog filename asynchronously using interpolated
strings instead of hacks. Fix how expression evaluators'
lifetimes are handled to be sane.

2019-04-17: Fix bugs with click to configure status bar. It
didn't work with divorced profiles that had the status bar
enabled but no layout, and it didn't order the prefs panel
front.

2019-04-17: Order the stoplight hotbox above the statusbar.
Issue 7725

2019-04-17: Fix a bug where color presets were hidden in the
keybinding editor. Issue 7724

2019-04-17: Add launch_and_run example

2019-04-17: Show tab bar backing visual effect view when the
window has transparency and it is showing a fake title bar.
Windows with transparency don't draw a title bar background
(presumably because we set the background color to clear).
Issue 7721

2019-04-17: Fix a bug where shift+return didn't search in
reverse FFFFFFffffffuuuuuuuuuuu how many more decades of C
will it take before I stop making this stupid mistake. Issue
7718

Bindings warning. Issue 7713

2019-04-17: Don't leave iterm2_git_poll.sh in the directory
it was last in; move it back to the root asap. Issue 7711

2019-04-17: Cache the expression parser. Also create the
parsers directory so we can load them from disk. Include the
app version in the content hash to rebuild parsers on new
versions, just in case something not in the key changes
(like a bug fix in coreparser encoders or decoders).

2019-04-17: Cache grammars to speed up open prefs

2019-04-17: Make edit tab title a sheet. Fix a bug where the
text field didn't become first responder when invoked from a
script

2019-04-17: Add debug logging to git component and poller

2019-04-13: [bfp] Handle fonts changing. Filter out

window with it.

2019-04-13: Remove unnecessary copy mode delegate method

2019-04-13: Execute queued tokens when exiting copy mode.

lion fullscreen when an empty area must be left at the top.
Issue 7691

NSString.doubleValue is not localized FFS. Issue 7688

2019-04-12: [bfp] Fix non-template images and xcode 10.2
errors

2019-04-12: When restoring a session from an arrangement and
not attached to a server, don't overwrite the tty variable
with the value in the arrangement because it will be wrong.
Issue 7683

2019-04-11: Use the background update cadence for sessions
that are not active AND are idle. Active means that it needs
periodic redraws because it just became visible, it just
finished processing a batch of tokens, refresh was called
(usually because of user interaction), something happened
that requires a redraw right away (like toggling alterante
screen mode), it's time for blinking text to be redrawn, or
various other similar things. In other words, it's pretty
defensible. Idle means there's been no input from the PTY
for 3 seconds (configurable down to 1 second). Refactor the
cadence setting code to have less deep nesting. Issue 4513,
in response to a comment on 4/8/19

2019-04-11: Allow double-click on the area left of the first
tab in a minimal+compact window to maximize the window. Move
double-click handling in PSMTabBarControl into mouseUp so it
plays nice with double clicking on a cell to edit its title.
Clean up a bit of the toxic waste dump that is
PSMTabBarControl. Issue 7682.

2019-04-11: When OSC 2 has set the window title, we should
include that among the other title components. That means
evaluating the built-in session title provider but using the
custom window name as the effective session name. If the
built-in session title provider is not being used then the
OSC 2 name will override it completely (something to revisit
later). Issue 7672

2019-04-11: Don't add 'reveal script x' to open quickly

2019-04-11: Disable ping from websocket to fix timeout
exception. Issue 7681

2019-04-11: Use unordered_map instead of map for the cache
of number of full lines. Was significantly faster in an
informal test. Issue 6952

2019-04-11: When changing a tab title override for a tmux
session, send tmux a rename-window message. When it sends a
window-renamed notif, update the tabTitleOverrideFormat

so that the the session whose titlebar you double clicked is
the one that maximizes

title to general pane to reduce user confusion as there have
bee many issues filed

key when touch bar is enabled

2019-04-06: Make it possible for the git statusbar component

string' actions so that raw actions can use them. Issue 7669

2019-04-02: When checking if a session should prompt to
quit, always skip the process for _shell.pid. If its name is
'login', skip an extra level (the shell). Issue 7661

2019-04-02: macOS gets confused when toggling nonnative
fullscreen and thinks all the windows were closed. Ensure we
don't quit automatically in this case. Issue 7668

2019-04-02: Remember the order of sessions when they're
maximized. Issue 7665

2019-04-02: Simplify taking an image of a tab; do not try to
fill in the tabbar area, which never looked good or worked
right. Make tab dragging look better. Issue 7632

2019-04-02: When dragging a tab into its own window is
disabled don't show the preview window. Issue 7632
