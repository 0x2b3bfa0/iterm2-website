paste bracketing enabled and "00~" + [prefix of the thing
they were pasting] shows up in the output soon thereafter.
Issue 8645 and about a thousand others.

2020-01-24: Arcify PTYSession+Scripting. Use the ready:
rather than completion: callback for replying to a split
command so the session will be immediately writable. Also,
return nil if the created session is DOA (has no window, and
therefore no object specifier)--returning a session with a
nil object specifier is an exception. Issue 8644

2020-01-24: Update the keymapper's configuration before
calling shouldSendEventToController:context:. Somehow in
issue 8260 the config was out of date which caused
inconsistent behavior between the check in
keyDown:inputContext: and the check in
keyMapperShouldBypassPreCocoaForEvent:. This is a problem
for the very first keypress in a new session, since the
configuration will be uninitialized.

2020-01-24: Select the pane under the cursor in focus

2020-01-17: Make proc_pidinfo asynchronous and
out-of-process. Issue 8615.

This commit adds a pidinfo xpc service. It runs proc_pidinfo
in a concurrent dispatch queue. It counts the number of
times it gets wedged and then kills itself when it exceeds a
threshold.

A few other bugs were fixed along the way: - Fxes a bug
where toggling fullscreen on a hotkey window hides it.  -
The proxy icon's URL is now always the local directory - The
last local directory is now tracked separately from the last
directory, which may or may not be on a remote host.

Now that the tab bar is a title bar accessory, it can simply
behave like a normal app.

2020-01-09: Fix bug introduced by commit
2067c5e19b3b2ab6aabc8a0d71d7aad3ad73f7df that caused the tab
bar not to be visible when revealing the menu bar in native
full screen, which was noticed in issue 8603 (1/8 comment by
nicm). A gray bar does appear when switching from regular to
minimal theme, but that's a better bug to live with.
