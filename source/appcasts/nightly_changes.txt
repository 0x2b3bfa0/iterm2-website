2020-02-22: When attaching to tmux set window origin after
calling the completion selector because it may affect the
window's size (e.g., by burying the attaching session). This
fixes a bug where the window moves up by the height of the
tabbar when attaching to tmux with a single session that
auto-buries. Issue 8639

2020-02-22: Use process cache to query for oldest child of a
process. An attempt to fix 8716

scripts

2020-02-09: When restoring a  profile in automatic profile
switching, prefer the underlying profile to the saved copy.
Only use the saved copy if it doesn't exist. This is because
we want changes to the underlying profile to be applied. For
example, changing the colors for to match dark mode. Issue
8677

launching bash with INPUTRC=/dev/null; don't use bracketed
paste even if enabled; use base64 --decode, which works in
both BSD and Gnu.

of an uninitialized value.

2020-02-08: Ensure the tabbar control's delegate is not the
window controller before closing its tabs. This could be
necessary if windowWillClose doesn't get called for some
reason.

2020-02-08: Ignore errors from tmux after trying to set
window sizes. That's because we update window sizes when a
window closes, and if many tabs/panes close at once (e.g.,
cmd-shift-W) then it will try to resize a window that
doesn't exist and the connection will break.

2020-02-06: Fix a nil string crash

2020-02-06: Don't call _setWebSecurityEnabled: if it doesn't
exist. This probably means that javascript in script-driven
popovers can't make API calls any more.

2020-02-06: Don't register or unregister a shortcut while
the session is supsended since that hits an assert. This can
happen when a bonjour host appears/disappears. This needs
more testing.

2020-02-06: Fix an out of bounds lookup when removing
nameless APS entries in prefs

2020-02-06: If there is no user fixed pitch font, fall back
to the system font. Fixes a crash in font size estimation
when it's given a nil font

2020-02-06: Fix extremely frustrating longstanding crash.
Don't do things in dealloc. This ended up calling into metal
availability checks that caused the window to get retained
and autoreleased, leading to a zombie.

automatic mode that adjusts between light and dark rainbows
depending on the background color of window decorations.
Issue 8101

2020-02-02: Move dock hiding and menu bar hiding logic into
its own class. Consider which screen has the dock when
deciding whether to hide it, rather than assuming it's
always on the main screen. Issue 8487

bracketing has been left on when they paste something with
paste bracketing enabled and "00~" + [prefix of the thing
they were pasting] shows up in the output soon thereafter.
Issue 8645 and about a thousand others.

2020-01-24: Arcify PTYSession+Scripting. Use the ready:
rather than completion: callback for replying to a split
command so the session will be immediately writable. Also,
return nil if the created session is DOA (has no window, and
therefore no object specifier)--returning a session with a
nil object specifier is an exception. Issue 8644

2020-01-24: Update the keymapper's configuration before
calling shouldSendEventToController:context:. Somehow in
issue 8260 the config was out of date which caused
inconsistent behavior between the check in
keyDown:inputContext: and the check in
keyMapperShouldBypassPreCocoaForEvent:. This is a problem
for the very first keypress in a new session, since the
configuration will be uninitialized.

2020-01-24: Select the pane under the cursor in focus
follows mouse when switching spaces. Issue 3258

2020-01-24: Refactor focus follows mouse logic

2020-01-17: Remove most of safelySetStyleMask: because the
issue was fixed in 6980b22ed15dd03c4396ea52745ce0e753fbc6f6

2020-01-17: Prevent rentrant calls to setStyleMask:

2020-01-17: Make proc_pidinfo asynchronous and
out-of-process. Issue 8615.

This commit adds a pidinfo xpc service. It runs proc_pidinfo
in a concurrent dispatch queue. It counts the number of
times it gets wedged and then kills itself when it exceeds a
threshold.

A few other bugs were fixed along the way: - Fxes a bug
where toggling fullscreen on a hotkey window hides it.  -
The proxy icon's URL is now always the local directory - The
last local directory is now tracked separately from the last
directory, which may or may not be on a remote host.

2020-01-09: Update tab bar when changing the 'flash tab bar'
setting

2020-01-09: Turn off flash tab bar in fullscreen by default.
Now that the tab bar is a title bar accessory, it can simply
behave like a normal app.

2020-01-09: Fix bug introduced by commit
2067c5e19b3b2ab6aabc8a0d71d7aad3ad73f7df that caused the tab
bar not to be visible when revealing the menu bar in native
full screen, which was noticed in issue 8603 (1/8 comment by
nicm). A gray bar does appear when switching from regular to
minimal theme, but that's a better bug to live with.
