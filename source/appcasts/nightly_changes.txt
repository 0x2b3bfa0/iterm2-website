2020-04-01: Use view-based tableview for profile tags.
Adjust the row height to look more normal

2020-04-01: Make about window wider

2020-04-01: Hide vertical scroller in large composer view
because legacy scrollers there are ugly as sin

2020-04-01: Use visual effect view for minimal paste
progress view. ARCify PasteView and FindView to prevent
leaks

2020-04-01: Use a visual effect view for the minimal find
view

2020-04-01: Respect prompt before closing settings when
closing all tabs in window. Issue 8800

2020-04-01: Clean up some odds and ends in the composer

2020-04-01: Add composer tip of the day

2020-04-01: Add a menu item to open the composer. Add some
polish to the existing status bar composer UI. Add a new UI
for when there isn't a status bar.

2020-03-31: Make the hamburger button in the toolbelt open
on mouse-down

2020-03-30: Truncate tail of toolbelt titles

2020-03-30: Fix hamburger frame when resizing width of
toolbelt

2020-03-30: Fix centering of toolbelt titles

2020-03-30: Add hamburger menu to toolbelt

2020-03-30: Remove header view from jobs tool

2020-03-30: Use a visual effect view behind the toolbelt in
10.14+

2020-03-29: Hide shared background image when subpixel AA is
on. Make legacy scrollers opaque when using shared bg image
since now there isn't anything under them. Fix the fill
operation when drawing the background color. I couldn't find
any case that need NSCompositingOperationCopy, so I changed
it to SourceOver only but I might have missed something.
Also, delay disabling blur because it seems to happen faster
than updating the view hierarchy and it looks bad for one
frame.

2020-03-29: Make toggling separate background images per
pane immediately update GPU renderer availability

2020-03-29: Make changes to 'use GPU rendering' take effect
immediately

2020-03-29: Fix ugly subpixel AA with legacy renderer on
10.14+. macOS fails to find the right background color and
it looks horrible. This diff makes iTermTextDrawingHelper
draw the background color itself in such cases, and the
background color view is hidden. However, legacy scrollers
still need something behind them so this diff adds a new
view to provide a background color there.

2020-03-29: Extend MTKView under per-pane titlebar and
per-pane bottom status bar. This makes background images
match the legacy renderer, which places an imageview under
the session view.

2020-03-29: Fix a bug where tasks would get
double-registered. When you launch a job, don't add it to
unattached children. If the orphan server adopter comes
along later it'll adopt those children and register them a
second time. When one of those jobs gets killed by closing
the window, only one of the registered tasks gets removed.
The other hangs around and causes select() to return an
EBADF error right away, making everything hang.

Close file descriptors and set their fd to -1 atomically to
avoid possible race conditions where the same FD gets closed
twice, possibly closing some random other thing.

Make extra sure that when a file descriptor is closed it
also gets deregistered.

Fix a bug where we'd deregister a task while iterating the
array of tasks, thus mutating the array that was being
iterated.

2020-03-29: Remove stray space

2020-03-29: Fix some warnings related to multiserver and
rootTerminalViewTabBarBackgroundColorIgnoringTabColor and
left shift of signed long long uniqueID.

2020-03-29: Improve performance of background images on
10.14+ by putting them in their own view for the legacy
renderer. Issue 7399

2020-03-28: Deal with spacelessApplicationSupport that's
empty or contains spaces. Issue 8792

2020-03-28: Add debug logging for issue 8792

2020-03-28: Add more variants to hostname using the first
part of the host name, provided there are at least two
parts. Issue 8786

2020-03-27: Add support for VSCodium to semantic history

2020-03-27: Don't count border width as decoration on macOS
10.14. Issue 8571. This won't affect 10.13 because it
doesn't get the fancy border views.

2020-03-27: Set the disconnected flag before calling
tmuxHostDisconnected so that it can't try to resize the
window as a side-effect of unburying the gateway. Issue 8793

2020-03-27: Adjust search results minimap size to match
width of overlay scroller. Use animations to match the
scroller's animations.

2020-03-26: Tweak color of X in tab colors menu. Reset state
on mouse exit.

2020-03-26: Polish the heck out of the tab color menu item

2020-03-25: Adjust alpha value of light text in autocomplete
popover to improve legibility

2020-03-25: Update search query from find pasteboard when
switching tabs, creating temporary status bar search field,
or changing panes. Issue 8784

2020-03-24: Improve multiserver logging

2020-03-24: Fix cmd-shift-up/down arrow in text views

2020-03-24: Turn off zombies in nightly build.

2020-03-23: Require user consent to clear scrollback history
with CSI 3 J. Fix a bug in announcements that have shortcuts
and are dismissable by keydown that the shortcuts didn't
work. Issue 5058

2020-03-23: Fix initial enabled state of the configure
status bar button when show status bar is off

2020-03-23: Never produce a null string from
iTermFindPasteboard. Issue 8783

2020-03-23: Get rid of absurd hacks from a long time ago.
Now that there are real weak pointers, I don't need to keep
track of whether a PTYSession is registered. In fact, I
think I never had to do it at all; I should've just nilled
out PTYTask's delegate after calling stop.

2020-03-23: Make orphan adoption more async. Search for
sockets in a background queue. There's no need to block the
main queue while doing any of this work. It's guaranteed to
begin only after all window states have finished restoring,
and can then take as along as it likes. Issue 8781

2020-03-22: Fix a bug where the flags-changed event tap was
disabled when the app resigned key and the app that was
becoming key had secure input turned on. You can actually
run a flags-changed event tap when secure input is on. This
caused a really hard to understand bug where double-tap to
open hotkey would break when both iTerm2 and the app being
switched to had secure input enabled. Issue 8180

2020-03-22: Handle unsupported shell when using
internet-based shell integration installer

2020-03-22: Fix a bunch of bugs in internet-free shell
integration installation.

2020-03-22: Support ZDOTDIR in internet-free shell
integration install. Update the wording in the steps to be
more accurate

2020-03-22: When you add your first touch bar item post a
notification explaining how to customize the touch bar.
Issue 8775

2020-03-22: Improve how the find pasteboard is used. Only
update the key window's search fields. When you do Erase
Search History, clear out the current query. Issue 8782

2020-03-21: Giant refactor of key bindings code.

Add iTermKeystroke, iTermTouchBarItem,
iTermKeybindingAction, iTermKeyMappings,
iTermTouchbarMappings, and iTermPResetKeyMappings. Delete
ITKeyBindingMgr.

Various odds and ends got cleaned up.

The only real fix is that now shortcuts in the table views
will be consistent with shortcuts in the shortcut input
view. For example, shift + : will show up as ; in both
places now.

Issue 8770

2020-03-19: Tweak wording of inline image display permission
prompt. Issue 8771

2020-03-18: Giant refactor of multiserver. Fixes a bunch of
synchronization bugs. Introduces some new synchronization
mechanisms to make code like this safer.

Also fixes a bug where multiserver didn't catch sigpipe.

2020-03-18: Fix leak of session made from adopting an orphan

2020-03-14: Prevent a crash when controlTextDidEndEditing:
is called on the window arrangement prefs panel but now row
is selected. Happens if you delete a row while editing it
name.

2020-03-14: Add option to focus window on right or middle
click. Issue 4918

2020-03-14: Don't close tmux integration session if a window
doesn't exist when you try to open it. The window may have
died on its own after it was created. Issue 8767.

2020-03-14: Add a checkbox to the tmux dashboard to control
whether it opens when there are hidden windows. Issue 8691

2020-03-14: Show search result locations in scroll bar.
Issue 5302

2020-03-12: Allow 2-touch mouse-down to get reported. Issue
8481

support DynamicProfiles itself being a symlink

2020-03-11: Use dark text on fake window title bar when it
has a light tab color

2020-03-11: Update title and border views when changing the
tab color so that when there's a Minimal window without a
tabbar its background will change. Issue 8760

2020-03-11: Add debug logging for all NSBeep calls

2020-03-11: Don't create a flags-changed event tap when the
advanced pref says not to. Issue 3316

2020-03-11: Save overridden fields in arrangement. When
restoring, use the underlying profile when available and
then modify it by copying over the overridden fields from
the arrangement. Issue 8759 (and countless others)

2020-03-09: Remove some silly functions that didn't need to
exist

2020-03-09: Fix a bug where option to not report a mouse
event was broken in the recent refactor. Issue 8756

2020-03-08: Cancel three finger tap if the touches move.
Issue 8751

text field. Issue 4578

2020-03-07: Fix crash

spaces when pasting. Issue 6288

2020-03-07: Move tabbar into titlebar accessory when
channging number of tabs, if needed

2020-03-07: Change how smart selection actions are run to
use the command runner instead of system(). Log output to
script console. TODO: Ensure the command runner is retained.
Issue 8753

2020-03-06: Fix failing tests

2020-03-05: Fix the preview of window arrangements with
multiple monitors. Issue 8706

2020-03-05: Pass the curor's rect in place of the view rect
to UAZoomChangeFocus. This is what chromium does in
render_widget_host_view_mac.mm. Issue 8642

2020-03-05: Add the option of setting ITERM2_COOKIE in new
sessions. These cookies are reusable. If you need to be able
to launch Python scripts from an iTerm2 session without
confirmation, this is a secure way to do it. It is secure
because processes external to iTerm2 can't get their hands
on these cookies and the user has to give permission to
enable this; the threat model is to prevent access from
other apps, particularly web browsers, from gaining access
to the API. Suggested in issue 8714

2020-03-03: Allow Applescript to launc Python script with
absolute path. Issue 8717

2020-03-03: Don't crash if profiles have crazy values, which
can happen with dynamic profiles.

2020-03-03: Try to fix screenDidLock crash by removing
observer on dealloc. Use different method names for the
class vs instance observers so I can tell which one is
crashing

2020-03-03: Enable zombies in the nightly build to track
down crashes

2020-03-01: Call refresh immediately after handling input
that comes within 10ms of a keystroke to reduce latency.
This is good for about 20ms of latency with the Metal
renderer according to typometer.

2020-03-01: Disable metal stats to try to prevent memory
corruption

2020-03-01: Respond to OSC 4 and 10, and 11 with 16 bit
color components. See mailing list thread with subject line
"Vim cannot detect background correctly when ssh to a remote
server"

2020-03-01: Support control-arrow keys in CSI u mode. Issue
8719

2020-03-01: Add an experimental setting (on in beta) that
makes mouse wheel clicks always scroll. Issue 8419

2020-03-01: When TERM contains 'screen' convert control
sequences internally to xterm. Issue 8726

2020-03-01: Add support for translating TERM=screen codes
outside tmux integration

2020-03-01: Make window background not normally clear
because it breaks the light colored outline around windows
on macOS 10.15. Consequently, we do not need the tabbar
backing to be visible in compact windows. Also, fix how we
decide whether the division view should be visible when
tabbar is on loan

2020-03-01: Ensure window changes size when tabbar as
titlebar accessory disappears/appears. Ensure tabbar becomes
titlebar accessory when exiting full screen (either kind).
Issue 8731

2020-03-01: Organize the methods in PTYTextView into
sections and remove some dead code

2020-03-01: Replace calls to mouseHandlerCurrentSelection
with selection

2020-02-29: Move mouse handling code into its own file to
reduce the size of PTYTextView
