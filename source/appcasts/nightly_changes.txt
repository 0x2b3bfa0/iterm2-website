2019-09-19: Keep standard window buttons and shortcut
titlebar accessory from becoming visible when exiting lion
fullscreen and going to a window that doesn't have a
titlebar. Sometimes it gets wedged, too, for mysterious
reasons. I mean, it's also a mystery why the titlebar
accessory is visible when the titlebar itself isn't, but the
riddle is easily solved by observing that macOS is buggy.
Issue 8291

2019-09-19: Fix wrapping of captured output

2019-09-19: Defer clearing selection until mouse-up when
there's a click on a selection. This lets you drag it. Issue
8281.

2019-09-19: Fix inline images whose height is given in
cells. Issue 8280

2019-09-19: Add an advanced pref to save to paste history
when secure keyboard input is enabled. Issue 8263

2019-09-19: Add a title variable to the tab scope with its
actual (presentation) title

2019-09-19: Clarify how to create a new window in Python

2019-09-18: Reduce update cadence to once per second when
miniaturized. Issue 8269

in system prefs. Issue 6838

2019-09-18: Update window/tab title right away after OSC
0/1/2. Issue 8268

2019-09-17: Fix failing tests

2019-09-17: Don't redraw every time the mouse moves. Issue
8264

2019-09-17: Show a warning in paste history toolbelt and
popup if secure keyboard entry is enabled. Issue 8263

2019-09-17: Fix autoresizing mask of interpolated string
checkbox in triggers setup

2019-09-17: Use Menlo for paste history, command history,
and captured output tools. Issue 8245

2019-09-16: Add the ability to load and save keyboard and
touchbar presets. Issue 5278

2019-09-16: Make double-clicking in the SplitPanel perform
the split. Issue 8262

2019-09-15: [python] Bump version again. Somehow app.py was
out of date in 1.4

2019-09-15: [python] Bump version

2019-09-15: 3.3.5beta1

2019-09-15: Fix path in test_it2api.sh

2019-09-15: Make tmux profile use the 'Session Name' title
component by default. Issue 8255

2019-09-15: Add a preference to allow Profiles menu to open
in new windows by default (#399)

Also: * Update wording of openProfilesInNewWindow advanced
setting * Modernize wording of debug log in
updateAddressBookMenu:

2019-09-14: Remove a discrepancy between how the old pwd is
determined for new tabs vs new splits. If the current
directory is unavailable fall back to the directory it was
created with. This fixes a race condition where the pwd
isn't known while the job is starting up. Issue 8230

2019-09-14: Save a local copy of the cursor type so that the
profile is not affects when you get a control sequence that
changes it. Also fixes a bug with the touchbar mitigation
when pressing esc has the side-effect of changing the cursor
shape and it would get stuck. Issue 8172

2019-09-14: Clear selection on mousedown. Issue 8250

2019-09-14: Don't send up and down arrow keys when not in
soft alternate screen mode, even when there's no
commandRange (perhaps because shell integration is not in
use). Issue 8248

2019-09-13: Remove old busted nightly build signing code

2019-09-13: Add implementations of various tab-related
selectors that Cocoa apparently demands of everyone. Issue
8246.

2019-09-13: Update xterm keyboard presets to include
control+function keys. Issue 8241

2019-09-12: Enable code signing for nightly build. Perhaps
the dark magic will work. Issue 8218

2019-09-12: Improve legibility of git errors

2019-09-12: Add iTermSessionLauncher. Now the Python API
creates sessions asynchronously

2019-09-11: Clear selection when scroll wheel sends arrow
key. Issue 8235

2019-09-11: Enable window shadow after exiting lion full
screen. Issue 8231

2019-09-11: Add an advanced pref to enable semantic history
on network mounted filesystems

2019-09-10: Show tab color in per-pane title bar. Issue
8236.

Looks like this was lost unintentionally when the theme
class was added.

2019-09-10: Hide _NSTitlebarDecorationView (beta only).
Attempts to fix 8238. Seems like 10.14 always puts a gray
line under the bottom titlebar accessory. I don't know why
it's only sometimes present, but that seems to be a
framework bug. Issue 8238

2019-09-10: Replace the implementation of iTermWeakReference
with a safer one that uses ARC. A race condition was
discovered where you could create a new weak reference after
-dealloc gets called but before the notification gets
posted.

2019-09-10: Remove stray NSLog

2019-09-10: Fix launching tasks where the command has
backslashes inside double quotes. The way bash handles these
is super weird and counterintuitive. Overhaul escaping of
commands and args for single-use windows to fix bugs where
things didn't work when the path had spaces, such as
changing git branch via statusbar component.

2019-09-08: Update tutorial for new naming conventions

2019-09-08: Deprecate current_terminal_window in favor of
current_window

2019-09-08: Deprecate App.terminal_windows in favor of
App.windows. Issue 8224

2019-09-08: Add Session.tab, Session.window, and Tab.window.
Issue 8224

2019-09-08: Don't try to open files as URLs if we decided
not to try to stat them because they were on a network
filesystem. Issue 8227

2019-09-08: Fix height of prefs > general > closing

2019-09-08: Add better debug logging for 'i am divorced with
guid x but the sessions instance has no such guid' assertion

2019-09-08: Don't expose the existence of the placeholder
statusbar component in the context menu. Add 'disable status
bar' to it. Issue 8226

2019-09-07: Fix a bug where new Session objects would be
created when the layout updates. It was not necessary to
update tabs and windows on every session. Doing so was
problematic because the  call would only preserve the first
session of the first tab; references to other old sessions
would be replaced with references to new sessions. Issue
8225

2019-09-07: Deprecate Tab.async_select in favor of
Tab.async_activate, which has consistent naming with other
classes. Issue 8223

2019-09-07: Don't activate the app when creating a tab with
the API. Issue 8223

2019-09-07: Make it configurable whether you get prompted to
quit when there are no windows. Issue 7051

2019-09-07: Fix the build. Make travis hide all but the last
500 lines of build output because apparently bits are
expensive.

2019-09-07: Use namespaces for registered functions. Some
people had problems with duplicate RPC names because they
had multiple title providers or status bar providers that
used the same coroutine name. Probably issue 8179.

2019-09-07: When we get a mouse-up, we would copy to the
clipboard. The problem is that you can get the mouse-up when
you click in a terminal window while another app is running.
If there is a selection, it gets copied to the clipboard.
This causes a lot of confusion. I never found this because
apparently I have used cmd-tab exclusively for the last nine
years, and the bug dates back to 2003. Issue 8202 (and
dozens of others).

2019-09-06: Inline images didn't properly respect pixel
sizes, and rounded up to the next cell. Update insets so
that the exact pixel size can be granted when possible.
Also, fixes a bug in the GPU renderer where part of the
texture would be clipped if the texture was limited to 4096
pixels wide.

2019-09-06: Fix misalignment of images when there is
vertical spacing in GPU renderer vs legacy renderer. The
image needs to be shifted up by half the difference between
cell height with and without spacing. Issue 8191

2019-09-06: Modify release_stable to push

2019-09-05: When setting the icon title with OSC 1, enable
the session name component unless it's using a custom title
provider. When setting the window title with OSC 0 or OSC 2,
always include it in the window title. If users don't want
it, they have to disable 'Applications in terminal may
change the title'. Issue 8211

There's a bit of a hack here, which is that the icon name
and the profile name fight for control of the tab title.
Divorcing a session causes the icon name to be lost.

2019-09-05: Use dark appearance for scrollers in minimal
when the terminal background color is dark. Issue 8213

2019-09-05: Fix resizing panes by menu item to resize by the
proper interval. It should use the same step computation as
splitView:constrainSplitPosition:ofSubviewAt:. By using the
charWidth/lineHeight of the current session, sometimes
nothing would happen because there was an adjacent session
that had a larger font. Furthermore, the test for min/max
constraints was wrong. If the divider is moving down/right
then only the max coordinate constrain is interesting
because it limits how 'large' the offset of a divider can
be. If moving up/left, only the min coordinate constraint is
interesting. This changes the semantics of the 'direction'
parameter to be 1 for down/right and -1 for up/left, and
leaves the step size computation to PTYTab. Issue 8212

2019-09-05: Fix a bug where the cursor was advanced one cell
too far after inserting an image. Top-align sixel images
within their cells. Issue 8191

2019-09-05: Run Python API scripts through the user's shell.
Issue 8204

2019-09-05: Make textview first responder after stealing key
focus. Issue 8196

2019-09-05: Fix a bug where ascii letters that underflowed
to the left got clipped. Issue 8185.

metalImagesForGlyphKey:asciiOffset:size:Scale:emoji used
only the center point.  It looks like a cherrypick of
fccce19 broke support for ascii underflowed added in commit
fd7d393. But it was further broken by commit 36d5661, which
allows glyphSize to be different than cellSize for Mojave.
It did not account for left-side underflow. Luckily, commit
11050db fixed a similar issue with Iosevka, but only in the
vertical dimension. Because vertical and horizontal overflow
are treated differently, this change is made to affect only
the monochrome code path. See the comment in PTYSession.m
for more detail on this aspect of the change.

This commit adapts that change to also support horizontal
underflow.

2019-09-04: Truncate git branch when it gets too long to
fit. Issue 8198

2019-09-04: Translate italic -> inverse video for tmux
integration. Disable reverse-whole-screen mode, too. Issue
8203

2019-09-03: Fix a variety of crashes in 3.3.3beta2

2019-09-03: Preserve exact dimensions of sixel images when
possible. Issue 8191.

2019-09-03: Use it_makeWindowKey to avoid hiding hotkey
windows just after showing them when two have the same
keystroke

2019-09-03: Make pop icon/window title have the same effect
as setting the icon/window title. For icon title, it needs
to set the autoNameFormat. For both, it should poll tmux.
Issue 8190

2019-09-03: Fix control-backslash on Japanese keyboards and
Control-shift-/ on US keyboards. Issue 8162

2019-08-28: Don't open search history automatically. Only do
it when the user presses the down arrow. I should implement
my own completion because macOS's is super bad. When you
call complete: it enters a runloop of its own so you can't
catch esc. The problem is that you have to press esc a lot
of times to back out of search when the completion window is
open.

2019-08-28: Append to autolog files by default. Add an
advanced pref to revert to the previous behavior of
overwriting. Raised as a concern in email with subject line
'Item2 import'

2019-08-28: Use the 'bottom' margin when calculating the
min-y coordinate of images in GPU renderer. Because GPUs do
everything upside down, the bottom margin is on the top of
the screen. The 'top' margin varies based on the filler
space beneath the last line. This caused images to shift
vertically when shifting between renderers. Issue 8152

2019-08-28: Don't change color of window number shortcut in
minimal for colored tabs unless
minimalTabStyleTreatLeftInsetAsPartOfFirstTab is enabled.
Issue 8178

2019-08-28: Link to weather script

2019-08-28: Add weather example script. Issue 8179

2019-08-27: Don't throw an exception if a hostname has two
consecutive dots or leads with a dot or some other weird
thing

2019-08-27: Set the global currentAppearance when drawing
into an NSImage using the block-based drawing function.
Based on the users of this function this should only affect
graphic status bar components. Fixes a bug where they'd be
hard to see when using system light + iTerm2 dark theme.

2019-08-27: Show contextual menu when you right click on a
fake titlebar. Issue 8173

2019-08-27: Bring back a special case for control+slash and
control+backslash keys to fix a problem with
control-backslash on Japanese keyboard. The old code was
some nasty spaghetti that often worked by accident, but
there were some pearls in there. Issue 8162

2019-08-26: For tmux >= 2.1 try to detect if tmux is running
locally by checking if #{pid} matches a process named tmux.
If so, use #{pid_pane} to enable polling for the current job
in tmux integration.

Don't call updateTitleWithProcessInfo with a nil argument.
It causes the job name to be removed. This is very annoying
when polling causes it to be bumped twice in quick
succession, leading to the job name flickering in the title.

PTYTask now knows about tmux process IDs and uses them just
for this purpose.

Issue 8167

2019-08-26: Don't dismiss hotkey window when a Sparkle
window becomes key. Issue 8153

2019-08-25: Fix typo

2019-08-25: Improve EachSessionOnceMonitor docstring

2019-08-25: [python] Bump version

2019-08-25: Add EachSessionOnceMonitor

2019-08-25: Fix broken method for fetching a range of lines
from history.

2019-08-25: Fix the number of lines restored

2019-08-25: Minor refactor to clarify some confusing names

2019-08-24: Fix analyzer complaints, including some small
memory leaks. Mostly nullability issues that were missing
annotations.

2019-08-24: Objective C at its very worst. I accidentally
named a method after one that has special significance and
the system called it with an argument of the wrong type.
Rename it to avoid the stupid.

2019-08-24: Don't crash if the smart selection rules are
somehow out of bounds. I saw this in crash log
1566551545.1049778259.txt. I guess this happened because
user defaults changed out from under us, but still better
not to crash.

2019-08-24: Do not clear the selection on mouse up single
click. This changes the behavior when clicking in a non-key
window that has a selection: now the selection won't be
removed. That's good because that's how macOS seems to work
(at least 10.14, which is all I tested). Furthermore, it
fixes issue 7871 where the OS reported click=0 for no good
reason. The selection has always been removed in
mouseDownImpl in .

2019-08-24: ARCify NSImage+iTerm to fix a memory leak in
it_imageWithTintColor: where the image is copied but not
autoreleased. Issue 8163

2019-08-24: Fix type annotations for Size and Point

2019-08-24: Bump default git component timeout to 4 seconds

2019-08-24: Add setprofile Python example

2019-08-24: Option+tab drag now moves the window. Issue 8123

2019-08-23: Set the hotkey window type in PseudoTerminal's
initializer prior to setting the window because otherwise it
will set the collection behavior so that it can become full
screen and if you're currently on a fullscreen desktop then
it'll try to make the hotkey window lion fullscreen and it
dies with an assertion.

2019-08-23: Add advanced pref to use black for tmux filler
area in fullscreen. Issue 8151

2019-08-23: Update the session's scrollbar style just after
creating the tab for a tmux layout and before reporting the
session size so they'll be taken into account in
-tmuxSizeForHeight:. This affects full screen windows only
when the system setting is for legacy scrollers. Issue 8074

2019-08-22: Make default tab stop width configurable in
advanced prefs. Issue 8149

2019-08-22: Don't escape command line args to tar when
making an archive for it2ul. It is not passed through the
shell so escaping is not necessary. Issue 8148

2019-08-22: Change split in context menu to use the current
profile. Issue 8147

2019-08-21: Disable 'set title by control sequence' when
title components don't allow the effect to be visible. Issue
8145

2019-08-21: Poll for working directory if insecure escape
sequences are disabled. Issue 8144

2019-08-21: Fix the tag on 'erase search history' to avoid
showing a checkmark when case-insenstiive regex is selected.
Issue 8143

2019-08-21: Ensure left-side tabbar is wide enough for
buttons and window number in compact and minimal. Issue
7988, in the comments.

2019-08-21: Add icons for Elixir and Erlang

2019-08-21: More process icons

2019-08-21: Add some process names for Redis and PostgreSQL

2019-08-21: Specify preferences section

This message confused me a bit the first time as it wasn't
obvious which section of Preferences this would be on. This
would make it easier for anyone to find it.  2019-08-21:
Send encoded files for it2ul really fast. Add an advanced
pref to disable this. Issue 8142

2019-08-19: Avoid changing window type after exiting lion
fullscreen if unnecessary. When changing window type, remove
the contet view from its old superview before setting it as
the content view of the new window because macOS just can't
seem to do anything right (you get a visual effect view
covering everything, and it's a subview of the NSThemeView).
Issue 7988

2019-08-19: Add the option to abbreviate the hostname when
on localhost. Issue 7705

2019-08-19: Make flashing tabbar overlap content and hide
its backing when on top. Issue 8130

2019-08-18: Add better logging to track down assertion in
divorcing a session where its profile has disappeared.

2019-08-18: Fix an out-of-bounds read. I'm not quite sure
how to reproduce it, but I can tell from the crash logs and
disassembly that it read of the end of one of the _datas
byte arrays.

The crash report with the smoking gun was
1565202147.246087595. It performed a read at offset 0xa003,
which was past the end of a buffer of size 0xa000. This
could happen if there was a fractional size or the canvas
size doesn't match the _size. I don't know the root cause,
but at least this should stem the bleeding.

2019-08-18: Don't crash if the font picker returns nil for
one of the fonts. Not sure why that would happen, though.
Fixes a common crash.

2019-08-18: Update BetterFontPicker.framework

2019-08-18: Add more BFP user data to gitignore

2019-08-18: Remove user data

2019-08-18: Don't use force unwrapping. I'm not sure why
this was crashing (presumably nil) but just reload the table
and return if things are nutty.

2019-08-18: Update description of advanced pref
URLCharacterSet to include file names and instructions to
restart.

2019-08-18: Allow top-of-screen windows to overlap the
titlebar. Issue 8132.

2019-08-18: Fix how the coordinates in AddHiddenAnnotation
are bounded. There was a bug where they were bounded by the
cursor position, not the bottom right of the screen. Issue
8111

2019-08-17: Make dark high-contrast more visible by default
and add an advanced pref to make it pretty. Issue 7563

2019-08-17: Replace control characters in titles with
caret+letter instead of question mark. Issue 8124

2019-08-15: Ensure secure keyboard entry is turned on when
app launches. Before it would not happen until the menu
validated or the app became active.

2019-08-15: Fix a bug where secure keyborad entry
incorrectly used the Search History user default preference.
Includes a migration path to preserve settings from the
buggy time.

2019-08-15: Change default title components to Job. I don't
know why it was set to session name, and previous that
profile name. Setting it to Job fixes the migration from
3.2, where that was the default behavior. Also, job is just
more useful than profile name which for many people is just
"Default". Issue 8115

2019-08-15: Fix escaping of control characters in JSON
strings. Issue 6764 (@yacn's comments)

2019-08-15: Allow moving tmux windows between sessions by
holding option/command (#391)

The tmux dashboard allows linking windows between different
sessions via drag-and-drop. This change modifies that
behaviour, such that if option or cmd are pressed during the
drag, the window will be moved instead of linked.

2019-08-14: Don't create app support symlink if the advanced
pref is set to empty string

2019-08-14: Change how URLs in smart selection actions are
escaped to be less broken. It's still kinda broken. Issue
8088. See issue 8119 for the task to unbreak this mess in
general

2019-08-14: Don't try to CFRelease null

2019-08-14: Replace the call to CGContextSelectFont with
CGContextSetFont. Turns out it works fine and is much
faster. Issue 8105

2019-08-14: Don't loan tabbar to titlebar accessory when
it's configured to flash. Issue 8112.

I considered a lot of options:

1. When flashing, remove from title bar accessory and add to
root terminal view controller. Rejected because you might
show the title bar during a flash. Also, really freaking
complicated.  2. Reveal the title bar and tab bar instead of
the old flash animation. Rejected because it does not appear
to be possible. Even if it were, it's too tall.  3. Create a
copy of the tab bar and flash that. I like this the best,
except the complexity is absolutely astounding. No way.  4.
Disable flashing for non-native tab bars. Rejected because
it doesn't make any sense for users. Breaks existing
workflows.  5. Don't loan the tabbar to the titlebar
accessory vc if flashing is enabled. This basically gets us
back to the pre-3.3.0 behavior.  6. Just show an image
instead of a real tab bar. I tried this, but it was also
pretty complex. It will inevitably have a lot of problems
because it's not the real thing, snapshots are flaky,
accessibility will probably be an issue, etc.

2019-08-13: Disable metal after creating an annotation

2019-08-13: Don't return a hidden tab bar control from
hitTest:. Fixes a bug where double-clicking the window
shortcut label when there's a fake window title label didn't
work. Issue 8110

2019-08-12: Fix Applescript 'tell session to set name to x'.
Commit 8393a4e57 tried and failed. Setting the
autoNameFormat is not resilient because it often gets
overwritten with the session's profile name, such as when
you open Edit Session. I don't see any reason why
Applescript should be different than modifying the session
name in Edit Session. See Lorenzo's comments in issue 7621

2019-08-12: Apply
https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/pull/368 to libssh2 to
test the fix to escaping tildes in file paths

2019-08-12: Show a dialog after not installing the python
runtime because you already have it. Happens if you install
after deleting the symlink and relaunching

2019-08-12: Make the name of the ApplicationSupport symlink
configurable. Issue 6746

2019-08-11: Adjust left inset of stoplight buttons to match
the top inset. Affects compact theme and Minimal theme when
tab height is adjusted downwards. Issue 8046.

2019-08-11: Add status bar icon to docs

2019-08-11: [python] Bump version

2019-08-11: Don't forceFrame if the frame is on the first
screen

2019-08-09: Eliminiate uses of half and half4 in favor of
float and float4. Word on the street is that most GPUs don't
support half. More importantly, the Metal compiler s with
halfs and doesn't with floats. See issue 7941

2019-08-09: Set window collection behavior when replacing
the window at runtime. Issue 8100

2019-08-09: Work around a macOS bug where windows jump to
the main screen after you replace the window controller's
window.

2019-08-09: When entering traditional fullscreen don't
auto-hide the dock if the dock is on a different display
than the window. Issue 8096.

2019-08-09: Automatically convert drag of a tab into a
window drag when: 1) the theme is compact or minimal, and 2)
the tab bar is visible, and 3) there is only one tab. Issue
8080

2019-08-09: Fix a bug where the status bar icon's tint color
was set incorrectly in updateIconIfNeeded (didn't take the
text color into account). Issue 8097

2019-08-08: Remove the corner radius from the window size
view because Visual Effect Views don't work right over a
semi-transparent window.

2019-08-08: Create a temporary status bar find driver when a
session needs but does not have one. Happens after moving a
session into a split pane when it has a temporary find
field. Issue 8084

2019-08-08: Ensure the cursor is below the 'session
restored' banner.

2019-08-08: Don't try to micromanage the composer popover's
appearance pre-10.14. Caused white-on-white text. Not sure
the underlying cause and not important in this case. I don't
trust appearance stuff on 10.13. Issue 8076

2019-08-06: Set termID just before computing the autolog
filename. Do not set it early before the tab number is
known. The tab number is not known until the session's tab
is added to a window. Trying to catch it at just the right
moment is very hard, but it should be safe to defer doing
until we are ready to fetch the autolog filename because
that happens before the job is launched. Issue 8053
