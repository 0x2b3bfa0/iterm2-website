2019-02-13: Add a new trigger type to create annotations. It
is super cool when used with registered functions. Issue
5772

2019-02-13: Fix the broken 'Show Notes' context menu item.

2019-02-13: Disable Metal when annotations are open. This
should be cherrypicked to 3.2

2019-02-13: Add option to import profiles from JSON. Issue
7533

2019-02-11: Remove assertion. The interval tree can
represent negative values. Because it does not deserialize
them, we should be safe.

2019-02-11: Update the stable layout algorithm to
preallocate space to infinite-priority views (find and paste
progress) so they don't get too squished if the sum of
spring constants of the other views is extremely large.

2019-02-11: Some voiceover improvements: remove trailing
newlines, fix a crash when VO asks for a bogus range, and
only mark it changed when updateDirty finds something.

2019-02-11: ARCify ToolCommandHistoryView. Issue 7534.

2019-02-10: Offer to replace an existing script rather than
aborting installation. This makes upgrading easier.

2019-02-10: Improve error handling for running and
installing scripts

2019-02-10: Tweak compact title and minimal tab colors.

2019-02-10: Fix how we avoid enumerating subdirs of app
support to actually work

2019-02-10: Unbreak edit session pref panel

2019-02-10: When toggling traditional fullscreen for any of
the windows without a titlebar besides compact (top of
screen, etc.) replace the window because it has the
compact-style window class which gives it an ugly titlebar.

2019-02-10: Hackily detect when the IME window is open and
adjust floating hotkey windows' levels down. Issue 7521

2019-02-10: Avoid enumerating nested directories in
application support at startup because the python API takes
an eternity

2019-02-10: Prevent restoring intervals into interval trees
with negative limits. Not quite sure where they came from
but they are definitely unwelcome.

2019-02-10: [python] Bump version

2019-02-10: [python] Update docstring for
async_invoke_function in all contexts

2019-02-10: Hide tabbar backing visual effect view only in
minimal theme. Fixes a bug where the titlebar was completely
transparent when using auto theme + macos dark mode +
compact window + no tabbar.

2019-02-10: Fix nightly build. Update sign_update to the
version from my fork of Sparkle at commit
d163511d43fa00d5b661b4f57b5f192b6c35df93

2019-02-10: Add the ability for scripts to invoke registered
functions. Register a move-tab-to-window builtin function.
Add APIs to call it and to invoke functions in the various
contexts. Still needs more testing.

2019-02-09: Fix a bug where the text view wrapper always
drew a top margin of 2, not the configured value. Issue 7520

2019-02-09: Work around bug in Mojave where the profiles
tabview didn't get all its labels drawn when the window
resizes. It really doesn't like being too small to fit all
the tabs, and when it grows it forgets to redraw itself. The
solution is to parent it in a view that refuses to make it
smaller than the safe minimum, which I simply hardcoded in
the interest of simplicity.

2019-02-09: Fix vertical alignment problem in appearance
prefs panes and dimming subtabs

2019-02-09: Add the option to preserve window size when the
tab bar shows/hides. Issue 5768

2019-02-09: Add an inner tabview to appearance prefs so I
can add to it without making it look uneven. It also looks
less intimidating now.

2019-02-09: Add git.sb

2019-02-07: Fix various inconsistencies in retain/release in
SIG code, and rename ivars not starting with _

2019-02-07: Add sanity checks to diagnose interval tree
entry with negative limit. Issue 7519

2019-02-07: Fix a bug where swifty strings didn't capture
their referenced variables

2019-02-07: Make trigger evaluation async so it can call out
to script-provided RPCs. Issue 7523

2019-02-07: Add an advanced pref to show a hint about split
pane direction in menu items. Issue 7524

2019-02-07: [statusbar] Run git in a sandbox to avoid
touching lock files. This is a cheaper solution than using a
modern version of git that includes --no-optional-locks,
since I'd have to distribute my own git binary because macOS
is (shocker) out of date. I also have more confidence that
this actually won't write anything.

2019-02-07: Update README.md

2019-02-07: Properly center window title on compact windows.
Issue 7528

2019-02-05: Ensure glyphSize is an integer. Should fix the
buffer overflow in performPostProcessing

2019-02-05: Clear bell when a session becomes active, either
by change split panes, changing tabs, or the window becoming
key. Add an advanced pref so users can revert to the
previous stickier behavior. Issue 7496

2019-02-05: Ignore carbon hotkeys while an app modal window
exists. Issue 7487

2019-02-05: Ask for accessibility permissions after failing
to create an event tap

2019-02-05: Bump up default prominence of text of
non-selected tabs when a tab has a colored background

2019-02-05: [cherrypick] Adjust text color for non-selected
tabs when one tab has a tab color. Because on Mojave we use
a visual effect view with a 25% black scrim over it we can't
be sure what the background color is. It's smarter to draw
black or white with some alpha blending instead. The alpha
blending level will be co ntrolled by the text prominence
setting. This makes a big difference in dark mode. Issue
7485

2019-02-05: Remember the vertical proportions of toolbelt
tools. Issue 7482

2019-02-05: Tell xcode I like my build settings just fine
thank you

2019-02-05: [cherrypick] Try harder to respect the default
toolbelt width. Do not constrain the toolbelt size in init,
before the view's frame's width is known. Just before
showing the toolbelt, constrain its width based on the size
we are willing to make the window.  Issue 4820

2019-02-05: Add downloadable archives of the tutorial
scripts

2019-02-05: Update change profile open quickly icon

2019-02-05: Remove log spam

2019-02-05: Remove gross hacks for open quickly window
highlighting in 10.14. I don't have a 10.13 machine to test
on at the moment so the change is limited to 10.14, but
it'll probably work on older OS versions

2019-02-05: Update script icon in open quickly

2019-02-05: Give cask-repair no input to fix it hanging

2019-02-04: When choosing a language, include all leading
three letter language codes and the first two-letter code.
Issue 5478

2019-02-04: Simplify iTermNotification

2019-02-04: [python] Update tutorial

2019-02-03: Add context menu to status bar components to
edit them (Issue 7516). Also fix a bug where rows & columns
wasn't always set in session variables (for restored
sessions), and fix a bug where text components that get
longer in equally spaced status bars become blank because
they don't get laid out again

2019-02-03: Fix messed up drawing in visible part of
TextViewWrapper (at the top of the text view). Issue 7506. I
wonder if I shouldn't use contentInsets instead of
TextViewWrapper. Doing so would require changing how
backgrounds are drawn to be drawn by a view behind the
scroll view, and I doubt that macOS could competently
composite views prior to 10.14.

2019-02-03: Sign all but developer builds with Developer ID
Application.

2019-02-02: Add support for legacy/traditional/modern to
beta and stable build scripts

2019-02-02: Update nightly build to use
legacy/transitional/modern appcasts

2019-02-02: Modernize app update a bit.

- Update sparkle to version 1.21.2, with my local changes
from https://github.com/gnachman/Sparkle.git (commit
2d63dd11408fda8e18fc60202143806f73ffed01) - Switch to
ED25519 signing - Modify appcast generation to use ED
signatures as well as legacy DSA signatures.  - Enable
signing for the nightly build (TBD if this actually works) -
Change nightly build to always update to nightly build,
irrespective of the 'beta' setting in prefs - Point all
builds at new appcasts, which will have only EdDSA keys.

The next beta, stable, and nightly build will be
"transitional" and will have both keys. Eventually, I will
stop distributing builds with DSA keys. Users on older
builds that have only DSA keys will need to upgrade to a
transitional build before they can upgrade to an EdDSA-only
build. The reasoning is documented here:

to make this easier to do.

2019-02-01: Don't check for runtime updates when you check
for app updates. It's silly.

2019-02-01: Finish implementing move of tmux max windows

algo. Change how priority is interpreted: larger values mean
more likely to be visible when space is tight. Fix various
bugs with showing and hiding the find component, when it is
both permanent (but invisible) and temporary.

2019-01-23: When a tmux window opens, do not set the local
window's origin unless it's the first tab in the window.
Issue 7484

2019-01-23: Fix double counting of division view when laying
out the root terminal view with a hidden top tab bar. This
caused tmux window sizes to become unstable. The root cause
of this bug which I keep hitting is that the client size is
based on the tabview's height divided by the height of a
cell; we then set the window's height to accommodate a
tabview that will fit that height in cells. When those two
cacluations are not inverses it becomes unstable. In this
instance the instability was that the root terminal view was
setting the tabview height one point smaller than it should
have been for the window height. That is possible because
the calculations are relatively distant. The root terminal
view, in its rather complicated layout method, calculates
tabview height as a function of window height. The inverse
calculation, 'f(tabview height)->window height', is done in
PTYTab.tmuxSize. It is further complicated by the fact that
tmuxSize is a mind-bendingly complex algorithm because it
has to deal with split panes. I don't see a sane way to put
these two functions next to each other, unfortunately. It
would be nice to add some tests, but even that is a hairy
mess because of all the dependencies on NSWindow and
NSScrollBar that would need to be injected. At least I'll
have this commit message to jog my memory next time... Issue
7483

2019-01-23: [statusbar] Disable jobs component popover in
10.13 because it looks bad. The text views and disclosure
triangles have a 50% alpha gray background. It looks like a
compositing bug to me because modifying the textfield's
alpha value does not fade it out but hiding the textfield
hides the background. And besides it is also on the
disclosure triangles so even if I beat the textfield into
submission I'd also have to make my own disclosure triangle
and honestly just F it Apple gives me nothing and I'm tired
of fighting

2019-01-23: Prevent the open quickly window from tricking
focus follows mouse into closing itself when it shrinks
while the mouse was over it

2019-01-23: Improve status bar popovers for 10.13

color.

under the menu bar. Issue 7108

2019-01-21: Make badge position configurable in UI.

2019-01-20: [statusbar] Change appearance of fixed and
variable spacers in setup UI depending on layout algorithm

2019-01-20: Fix a warning

2019-01-20: Fix a bug where theroot terminal view would
layout incorrectly when the tab bar was hidden and the
division view was visible. The division view's height was
not accounted for and the top decoration height was used
where it should've been the bottom. Cocoa's upside down
coordinate system will never stop causing bugs.

2019-01-20: Refactor the status bar view controller a bit
and simplify things. Fix a bug where status bar background
colors weren't drawn to the edge

2019-01-20: [statusbar] Allow fixed width spacers to specify
their width and priority. Fix how the stable layout

2019-01-20: [statusbar] Make fixed-size spacers really fixed
size in stable layout algo

2019-01-20: [statusbar] Improve the stable layout algorithm
to mostly work right. Still some work to do on fixed size
spacers.

2019-01-19: [statusbar] Refactor layout algorithm into its
own file. Begin working on one that has stable offsets
instead of tight packing

2019-01-19: Tweak the look of the job tree popover

2019-01-19: [statusbar] Clicking the job component shows a
popover with a tree of running jobs.

2019-01-18: Update find driver when status bar's components
may have changed. Fixes a bug where a permanent status bar
find component didn't work because it had no driver.

2019-01-18: Add a new window type of accessory for
single-use windows. It is a floating panel so it can share a
space with a full screen window.

2019-01-18: Change advanced settings to use a view-based
tableview. Implement an insane amount of disgusting hacks
because macOS is Apple's unloved stepchild. SRSLY BAD

2019-01-18: Check the width of subselections to avoid
running off the end of the array. Fixes a longstanding crash
that seems to repro when you restore a session with a
windowed selection whose right bounds is greater than the
width of the session.

2019-01-18: Add a bunch of logging for tabbar color

2019-01-17: Add a completion block to toggle full screen.

2019-01-15: Fixes a bug where underline offsets were
computed incorrectly. The INSANELY confusing
NSFontAttributeName and NSFontNameAttribute got me. F7U12

2019-01-15: [statusbar] Run four concurrent git poll
workers. Each takes a separate shard of paths so that if one
hangs others have a chance to work on non-network file
systems. Also don't update them when not visible, but do
update immediately when one becomes visible.

2019-01-15: [statusbar] Tweak spacing of git component. Move
dirty flag to be next to branch name.

2019-01-14: Introduce iTermLaunchExperienceController, which
coordinates the various cold-launch activities to avoid
spamming the user too much.

Remove check for incompatible software, which is outdated
and was never very useful.

Fix a bug in the onboarding window where clicking a page
indicator not adjacent to the current page would animate
wrong. NSPageController lived up to my expectations,
unfortunately.

Improve appVersionBeforeThisLaunch to work before
initializeUserDefaults is called.

Revamp about box and link it to onboarding window.

Not yet enabled.

status bar per window rather than per-pane, by a preference.
This makes status bars with tmux make a lot more sense.
Fixes a bunch of bugs with status bar colors and full screen
layout bugs.

2019-01-11: [api] Fix pip3's shebang when installing a
full-environment script so deps are only added to the folder
for the script, not globally

2019-01-11: Allow the mouse to move up to three points
during a drag and it will still be treated as a click,
unless something happens that commits it to the drag (for
example, changing the selection or beginning an image drag).
Issue 7465

2019-01-11: Add advanced pref to never use fastpath strings
so even alphanumeric characters can belong to ligatures.

2019-01-08: Make secure keyboard entry menu item more sane.

1. Selecting it toggles whether iTerm2 wants secure keyboard
entry.  2. The menu item shows a "mixed" state if it's on
but we don't desired it to be on. Presumably if we desired
it on then it's on, so no need for a mixed state there.

Issue 2078.

2019-01-08: Avoid needless NSUserDefaults calls that are
quite slow in cadence controller delegate

2019-01-08: [cherrypick from 3.2] Add a CPU profiler to

2019-01-08: [cherrypick from 3.2 of 2 commits] Enable
fastpath underlines in the legacy renderer. Issue 7437

After years of frustration I finally figured this one out!
It was trying not to set the font on the graphics context if
the font hasn't changed becaues it's slow. That was wrong
because the *context* changed, which is why the alpha mask
wasn't getting drawn into. This absolutely sucked to debug
both this time and in 2014, mostly because the CG APIs are
such a bloody mess of state and implicit dependencies.
