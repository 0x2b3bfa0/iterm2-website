2019-08-09: Eliminiate uses of half and half4 in favor of
float and float4. Word on the street is that most GPUs don't
support half. More importantly, the Metal compiler s with
halfs and doesn't with floats. See issue 7941

the window at runtime. Issue 8100

was set incorrectly in updateIconIfNeeded (didn't take the
text color into account). Issue 8097

2019-08-08: Remove the corner radius from the window size
view because Visual Effect Views don't work right over a
semi-transparent window.

2019-08-08: Create a temporary status bar find driver when a
session needs but does not have one. Happens after moving a
session into a split pane when it has a temporary find
field. Issue 8084

2019-08-08: Ensure the cursor is below the 'session
restored' banner.

2019-08-08: Don't try to micromanage the composer popover's
appearance pre-10.14. Caused white-on-white text. Not sure
the underlying cause and not important in this case. I don't
trust appearance stuff on 10.13. Issue 8076

2019-08-08: Allow git state cache entries to live for 10
seconds. After they reach 2 seconds of age, they'll be used
only if the command runner fails. Issue 8075

2019-08-08: Don't use black for the flexible view color. The
status bar makes it really ugly. I hope to eliminate the
flexible view soon, anyway. Issue 8074

2019-08-08: Restrict before & after text passed to semantic
history command to the logical window, since it is used when
choosing the text that was clicked on. Issue 8073

2019-08-08: Force session views to redraw when their window
becomes/resigns key to make the title view's background and

Issue 8058.

2019-08-07: Better logging for title function

2019-08-07: More tweaks to dark high contrast tabs

2019-08-07: Update how local directories are computed. When
we update because of a window title change, update the path
variable. When the pwd poller gets a directory, update a
mark. Generally simplify this horrid mess. Issue 8038.

2019-08-07: Don't use the tab color as the status bar
background color in minimal theme (when per-pane status bars
are turned off).

2019-08-06: Reset the collection behavior when exiting lion
full screen in LSUIElement mode. Issue 8048

2019-08-06: Set termID just before computing the autolog
filename. Do not set it early before the tab number is
known. The tab number is not known until the session's tab
is added to a window. Trying to catch it at just the right
moment is very hard, but it should be safe to defer doing
until we are ready to fetch the autolog filename because
that happens before the job is launched. Issue 8053

2019-08-06: Apply changes to status bar immediately. The OK
button now dismisses with no action and the cancel button
reverts changes. Issue 8054

2019-08-05: Add a comment relating the vm_stat command line
app to the struct

2019-08-05: Improve PromptMonitor to inform you when a

entering fullscreen. Issue 8027

wrong. Also indicate the the margins are in points in the
UI.

2019-08-05: Fix autoresizing mask of font picker in badge
config window

2019-08-05: Ensure the badge label size is correct when the

8007

2019-08-05: Fix some docstrings because there's an enum for
the initial working directory

2019-08-05: Activate the app before showing a modal
sheet/alert. This doesn't cover all of the many modal alerts
because it's just too much to test right after a release. It
fixes issue 7977 - opening the set tab title panel in a
floating hotkey window when another app is active causes the
window to disappear.

2019-08-05: Fix docstrings for other set variables calls

2019-08-05: Fix a bug where opening the open quickly window
would hide the hotkey window

2019-08-05: Make floating panel hotkey windows overlap the
menu bar. Issue 7984

2019-08-05: Fix a bug where closing a native fullscreen
window would cause a new window to be created. Issue 7987

2019-08-05: Change wording of setting to choose beta

2019-07-28: Update signatures of tutorial .its files because
their certs had expired. Add a 'resign' tool to
SignedArchive to make this easy to do.

changes

2019-07-27: Show tmux window title in window title when
available. See discussion in issue 6938

2019-07-27: Don't let the search field become first
responder while inside -[NSWindow makeKeyAndOrderFont:]. The
recents menu may be opened as a consequence of it becoming
first responder. That causes macOS to  its britches and the
window doesn't become visible. Issue 7965

under the menu bar. Issue 7963

2019-07-24: Use visual effect views behind popups

marks) that was previously not restored for reasons that are
unclear. Ensure the cursor appears after the session
restoration banner.

2019-07-21: 3.3.0beta15

2019-07-21: Add fs-only-status-bar example

2019-07-21: Bump python version

2019-07-21: [python, api] Improvements to subscriptions

- Make it possible to subscribe to variable change
notifications from all windows.  - Fix some python
docstrings that referred to Badges docs for info on
variables.  - Make it possible to use a VariableMonitor for
all windows.  - Add Window.async_get_variable - Fix a bug
where full screen windows didn't get
iTermDidCreateTerminalWindowNotification posted. This
prevented layout change notifications for new windows whose
style was full screen.

2019-07-21: Don't call titlebarAccessoryViewControllers on
non-titled windows because it asserts >:(. Issue 7956

2019-07-20: Fix support for full-height cursor in GPU

vertical bar cursor when there is vertical spacing

renderer. The bottom margin was double counted

2019-07-20: Fix vertical alignment of box-drawing characters
when vertical spacing is enabled. Issue 7932

2019-07-20: Fix text color of advanced prefs in 10.14

2019-07-20: Expose window style through the "style" variable
in the window scope. Legal values are:

"normal"; "non-native full screen"; "native full screen";
"full-width top"; "full-width bottom"; "full-height left";
"full-height right"; "bottom"; "top"; "left"; "right";
"no-title-bar"; "compact"; "accessory";

Expose window frame as a 4-element array in variables. A
dictionary would be better but I don't want to add syntax
for dictionaries now.

2019-07-20: 3.3.0beta14

2019-07-18: Fix a bug when switching from regular to compact
or minimal in a window with at least two tabs where the

2019-07-18: Add option to save APS logs to script console.
Issue 7953

2019-07-18: Reset inCommand when we get FTCS A. The only
case where it would go YES->NO is when the last-received
code was B, meaning the user was entering a command when a
new prompt came along. I can make this happen in tcsh by
using tab completion when ambiguous to show options. I
tested basic functionality in bash, zsh, and fish and
everything seemed to work with regualr use, aborted
commands, and ambiguous tab completion. Issue 7954

2019-07-18: Fix a bug where you couldn't close all tabs in a
fullscreen window with cmd-shift-w

2019-07-16: Allow polling for working directory up to once a

when there's a complex character whose lookup fails.

2019-07-16: Don't crash if a function call status bar
component has a nil label

2019-07-16: Don't crash on non-UTF8 encoded commands when
getting process name/args

2019-07-14: Fix bug where you couldn't add multiple status
bar items in Catalina. Issue 7875

2019-07-13: Keep the git status bar component from eating
all resources. Limit it to 4 megs of memory, 2 seconds of
CPU time, and run it at the lowest possible priority. When
it fails, erase the content of the status bar component to
avoid showing stale info

2019-07-13: Fix semantic history test

2019-07-10: Allow instant highlight triggers to fire more
than once per line. Issue 7934

2019-07-08: If a tmux window's title is empty, show the
active session's name in the tab.

Don't crash when the user erases a tmux session's tab title
override in edit session prefs.

Fix how validating nil arguments in built-in function method
calls works.

2019-07-08: Reduce the level of floating hotkey windows so
they don't overlap the menu bar. Issue 7924

2019-07-08: Change the keyboard shortcut for zoom to
cmd-shift-0. macOS seems to really want it to be this value.
On some machines, it's forced to be although it doesn't seem
to be tied to a particular OS version. It's annoying to have
shortcuts change, but it's even worse if they differ from
machine to machine for no reason. See issue 7894.

2019-07-03: Send CSI 32;2u for shift+space in CSI u mode.
Issue 7911

2019-07-02: Make it possible to view the output from a
semantic history command when it exits with a nonzero return
code. Issue 7915

2019-07-02: Don't attempt to connect to the ssh agent if you
have a predecessor, who already did it. Seems to be a bug in
NMSSH that calling connectToAgent a second time hangs
