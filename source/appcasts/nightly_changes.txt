process ID that owns a connection. Issue 8684

2020-02-09: Reject connection with no pids for issue 8684

2020-02-09: Support command line parsing for python3.8
scripts

2020-02-09: When restoring a  profile in automatic profile
switching, prefer the underlying profile to the saved copy.
Only use the saved copy if it doesn't exist. This is because
we want changes to the underlying profile to be applied. For
example, changing the colors for to match dark mode. Issue
8677

2020-02-09: Update prefs panel text for window border.
Enable it by default on 10.15 and up. Fix build break

2020-02-09: Draw nice round borders for transparent windows
on 10.14+. Issue 8681

2020-02-09: Temporarily disable respecting soft boundaries
if cursor leaves them while making a selection. Issue 8683

2020-02-09: Bump deployment target of UKCrashReporter.xib to
12.2. This fixes a warning. Amusingly, it still works on
12.1 because xcode is lying as usual

2020-02-09: Fix warning

2020-02-09: Enable some experimental features that are
ready. Reorganize them in the .m file to ease future updates

2020-02-09: Bump upgraded asserts to 100%

2020-02-09: Update UKCrashReporter to use a xib. Override
its window and implement closeCurrentSession: so cmd-w will
work with it

2020-02-09: Improve internet-free shell integration
installer: prevent inputrc from screwing up the prompt by
launching bash with INPUTRC=/dev/null; don't use bracketed
paste even if enabled; use base64 --decode, which works in
both BSD and Gnu.

2020-02-09: Interpret clean and dirty properly in remote git
state variables. It isn't a boolean.

2020-02-09: Fix incorrect vertical alignment of attribute
string status bar components when using nonstandard fonts.
It's especially obvious when you use Mono Extra Light 16.
Issue 8665

2020-02-09: Fix failing tests, a crash during test, and use
of an uninitialized value.

2020-02-08: Ensure the tabbar control's delegate is not the
window controller before closing its tabs. This could be
necessary if windowWillClose doesn't get called for some
reason.

2020-02-08: Ignore errors from tmux after trying to set
window sizes. That's because we update window sizes when a
window closes, and if many tabs/panes close at once (e.g.,
cmd-shift-W) then it will try to resize a window that
doesn't exist and the connection will break.

2020-02-08: Fix use of undefined variable

2020-02-08: When preferring full ligature support to speed
treat spaces as drawable characters. Issue 7461

2020-02-08: Fix typo

2020-02-07: Kill/hide tmux windows when closing a window
with Shell>Close Terminal Window

Issue 8673

is disabled, all tabs show all modifiers.

you're editing its session's name in the dashboard

2020-02-06: Don't crash when flipping a 0x0 image

2020-02-06: Don't try to sendaction to a menu with a submenu
for a keybinding. Not sure how that happened, though.

2020-02-06: Fix a nil string crash

2020-02-06: Don't call _setWebSecurityEnabled: if it doesn't
exist. This probably means that javascript in script-driven
popovers can't make API calls any more.

2020-02-06: Don't register or unregister a shortcut while
the session is supsended since that hits an assert. This can
happen when a bonjour host appears/disappears. This needs
more testing.

2020-02-06: Fix an out of bounds lookup when removing
nameless APS entries in prefs

2020-02-06: If there is no user fixed pitch font, fall back
to the system font. Fixes a crash in font size estimation
when it's given a nil font

2020-02-06: Fix extremely frustrating longstanding crash.
Don't do things in dealloc. This ended up calling into metal
availability checks that caused the window to get retained
and autoreleased, leading to a zombie.

2020-02-06: Don't crash if you try to show a download in
finder but it has no path for some reason

2020-02-06: Fix uninitialized error in scp download when a
download fails

2020-02-03: Fix background color of upload/download items in
10.14. Issue 8651

2020-02-03: Change LC_LANG to LANG. Also, let Xcode party on
the xib. Issue 8661

2020-02-03: Move code for managing the global variables into
its own file. Make how we observe theme changes current for
modern versions of macOS. Inspired by PR 413

2020-02-03: Don't limit max width of an attribute text
component to the view's size when computing its width. Issue
8665

2020-02-03: Make autorainbow a persistent setting that
updates colors as components come and go. Give it an
automatic mode that adjusts between light and dark rainbows
depending on the background color of window decorations.
Issue 8101

2020-02-02: Move dock hiding and menu bar hiding logic into
its own class. Consider which screen has the dock when
deciding whether to hide it, rather than assuming it's
always on the main screen. Issue 8487

2020-02-01: [python] Fix a bug where creating a
LocalWriteOnlyProfile from a Profile would mutate values in
the Profile by json encoding them.

2020-02-01: Add option for the password manager to require
reauthentication after the screen locks. Issue 6401

2020-01-29: Fix exception in accessibility stringForRange

2020-01-29: Fix call to UAZoomChangeFocus which follows the
cursor while zoomed to use the right screen offset. Issue
8642

2020-01-28: Add support for opening files with IntelliJ to a
line number. Issue 8650

2020-01-27: Close man page window when man ends. Issue 8649

2020-01-26: Only deliver scroll wheel events to the window
the event was originally destined for

2020-01-26: Introduce SearchableComboListView

This is a better control for picking an item from a long
list.

2020-01-24: Warn the user when we detect that paste
bracketing has been left on when they paste something with
paste bracketing enabled and "00~" + [prefix of the thing
they were pasting] shows up in the output soon thereafter.
Issue 8645 and about a thousand others.

2020-01-24: Arcify PTYSession+Scripting. Use the ready:
rather than completion: callback for replying to a split
command so the session will be immediately writable. Also,
return nil if the created session is DOA (has no window, and
therefore no object specifier)--returning a session with a
nil object specifier is an exception. Issue 8644

2020-01-24: Update the keymapper's configuration before
calling shouldSendEventToController:context:. Somehow in
issue 8260 the config was out of date which caused
inconsistent behavior between the check in
keyDown:inputContext: and the check in
keyMapperShouldBypassPreCocoaForEvent:. This is a problem
for the very first keypress in a new session, since the
configuration will be uninitialized.

2020-01-24: Select the pane under the cursor in focus
follows mouse when switching spaces. Issue 3258

2020-01-24: Refactor focus follows mouse logic

2020-01-24: Add yet more logging for issue 7481

waiting for the pidinfo service to start

2020-01-17: Eliminate synchronous: argument. Make
applescript do a dispatch_async before calling
resumeExecutionWithResult because it is a dumb api

2020-01-17: Remove most of safelySetStyleMask: because the
issue was fixed in 6980b22ed15dd03c4396ea52745ce0e753fbc6f6

2020-01-17: Prevent rentrant calls to setStyleMask:

2020-01-17: Make proc_pidinfo asynchronous and
out-of-process. Issue 8615.

This commit adds a pidinfo xpc service. It runs proc_pidinfo
in a concurrent dispatch queue. It counts the number of
times it gets wedged and then kills itself when it exceeds a
threshold.

A few other bugs were fixed along the way: - Fxes a bug
where toggling fullscreen on a hotkey window hides it.  -
The proxy icon's URL is now always the local directory - The
last local directory is now tracked separately from the last
directory, which may or may not be on a remote host.

2020-01-11: Fix restoration for custom shells. The
kProgramType was wrong. Issue 8616

2020-01-11: When a single character is selected, show its

8528

2020-01-09: Update tab bar when changing the 'flash tab bar'
setting

2020-01-09: Turn off flash tab bar in fullscreen by default.
Now that the tab bar is a title bar accessory, it can simply
behave like a normal app.

2020-01-09: Fix bug introduced by commit
2067c5e19b3b2ab6aabc8a0d71d7aad3ad73f7df that caused the tab
bar not to be visible when revealing the menu bar in native
full screen, which was noticed in issue 8603 (1/8 comment by
nicm). A gray bar does appear when switching from regular to
minimal theme, but that's a better bug to live with.

2020-01-09: Deliver scroll wheel momentum events to the view

tmux 3.0. Issue 8596
