status bar components so their function signatures and names
can change without breaking existing installs.

2018-12-27: Offer to launch status bar script when you click
the ladybug, then offer to move it to autolaunch if doing so
would make sense

for menu and auto launch. Fix launching full environment
scripts from a subdirectory.

2018-12-23: Call updatePaneTitles in reloadBookmarks since
the presence of a status bar, which is a property of the
bookmark, could affect whether pane titles are visible.

2018-12-23: Show number of lines and size in paste history

Issue 7232.

2018-12-22: [python] Change RPCs to use decorators

2018-12-22: Fix a crash after invalidating a swifty string.
I have a feeling there is a memory leak in here somewhere
because it should have been evaluated again.

2018-12-22: Update the session title in setProfile rather
than setPreferencesFromAddressBookProfile because the
profile is sometimes set after that and the session title
provider goes through a delegate and therefore needs the
_profile to be up to date. fixes a bug where setting the
session title seemed to have no effect.

2018-12-22: [python] Change how you register for RPCs to use
@RPC; async def func(); func.async_register(connection)

manager

2018-12-22: [python] Fix comment indentation

for it.  2. Change the proto to use the more standard
session_id field name.  3. Change the semantics to
communicate when a session's command exits rather than when
its window closes. Now a session can only terminate once,
which is much nicer.  4. Use a context manager instead of a
callback.

2018-12-22: [python] Reduce comment width so it looks better

2018-12-21: [python] Add customcontrol module, remove
notification for registering a custom control sequence.
Update docs and tutorial.

new window creation to reduce duplicate code.

2018-12-21: Fix label color in the open quickly window

advanced pref to allow it to keep the one from the profile
instead. Don't allow changing the status bar settings in
tmux edit current session.

faster, have variable width, and right-align the right side.

2018-12-21: Remove a hack for macOS 10.7 scrollbars. Ensure
that PTYScrollView holds a strong reference to its scroller,
although the superclass allows a dangling pointer to exist
somehow. This was causing a crash.

2018-12-19: Add support for subscribing to variable changes
in all sessions

2018-12-19: Preview the content mode of the background image
in prefs. Because macOS is a redheaded bastard stepchild it
doesn't have aspectFill so I have to do it myself, like a
farmer.

2018-12-19: Clean up window profile prefs. Hide the disabled
views in edit session mode. Reorganize views so it is
symmetrical

2018-12-19: Disable various useless controls in window prefs
in edit session dialog

2018-12-19: Give x-of-screen and no-title-bars the full-size
contentview window style mask so they'll have shadows. This
commit probably introduced a bug because this is o
preposterously complex

2018-12-19: Keep the git component's text color up-to-date

2018-12-19: Allow all window styles in minimal theme to use
the session's background color

2018-12-19: Hide signing options if there are no identities.
Adjust margins of accessory view.

2018-12-19: Add support for exporting and importing
auto-launch scripts. Only signed archives will offer the
option to import as auto-run

2018-12-19: Only return valid (non-expired, etc.)
certificates from allIdentities

2018-12-18: Implement importing signed script archives. Add
a new file extension of .itermscript. The icon doesn't show
up for some reason.

2018-12-18: Add the SignedArchive library source files to
the iTerm2 project. Add the ability to export a signed
script.

2018-12-18: Add SignedArchive project

2018-12-16: Work around a bug where toggling traditional
fullscreen would think you closed the last window

2018-12-16: Improve performance of native powerline glyphs.
Cache their images as bitmaps. Drawing them from PDFs was
very slow.

Issue 7420.

2018-12-16: Offer advanced paste from the various paste
warnings.

2018-12-15: Remove sanity checks, slow code paths, and
verbose logging from the line buffer and line block array.
This should improve performance for people with large
histories.

2018-12-15: Fix blending of timestamps to use premultiplied
compositing

2018-12-15: Do not attempt to render a metal frame if there
is no context. Better to spin the CPU a bit than to assert.
Still not an ideal situation, but I haven't been able to
reproduce the cause of nil contexts. I did see a crash due
to this. My guess is funny things happen when waking from
sleep, so it should only be a temporary problem.

2018-12-15: Add a check for overrun after postprocessing
character bitmap

2018-12-15: Fix warnings from ancient code. A new type was
added that caused confusion about the type of the selector
session. Objective C is scary.

2018-12-15: [api] Improve error logging, remove spurious
errors, direct errors to the right place in the scripting
console, and make statusbar ladybugs clickable to show the
error that caused them.

2018-12-15: [python] non-checkbox knobs were broken. Fix
them. Improve the docstring for the name argument of
statusbar registration

invisible because another one in the same tab is maximized.
Issue 7410

2018-12-13: Refuse to open the password manager when a probe
is active. A password manager trigger can fire while probing
and it gets all confused. Issue 7401.

2018-12-13: Fix color of "Shell integration must be
installed to use this feature" label. Was set to black,
broke in 10.14 dark mode. Issue 7419. Change by Ryan
Maroon."

2018-12-13: Fix a bug where we set the wrong window
collection behavior because a variable was shadowed. Caused
by 5062f7f7337ac8c3ecdf68c6fe3cbff26446821f. Issue 7416.

2018-12-13: Fix a bug where wrappedStringAt:... did not
produce coords in 1:1 correspondence with codes in the
returned string when there were combining marks. Issue 7415.

2018-12-13: [api. python] Add async_close to tab, window,
and session. Issue 7414.

2018-12-11: [semantic history] Add support for [line,column]
suffix. Issue 7398

2018-12-11: When semantic history matches a file test to see
if the next chunks would give a column/line number. That's
necessary because of the (x, y) suffix support since chunks
split on parens. Issue 7398

2018-12-11: [semantic history] Accept file(line,column)
without a space after the period. Issue 7398

2018-12-11: [python, api] Update keyboard interfaces.

Filtering is now a distinct subscription from keyboard
monitoring. It does not send notifications. This allows you
to filter separately from monitoring.

All the keyboard code is now in the same python file.

The examples are updated.

2018-12-09: Pinned, visible hotkey windows participate in
window cycle by default. Issue 7374

2018-12-09: Fix a bug where 'you must restart' alert shown
when toggling integrated/discrete GPU can't be dismissed.

2018-12-09: Don't scroll on control+page up/down in
performKeyEquivalent: if the receiver is not the first
responder. I don't know why macOS routes this event to a
view that isn't in the responder chain. Issue 7407

2018-12-09: Turn on font smoothing for non-antialiased text.
Fixes a bug in rendering PragmataPro on macOS 10.14. Issue
7394

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Record the use
transparency setting in the window's arrangement. Issue 7390

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Improve logging for event
taps

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Support filename(line,
column) for semantic history. Issue 7378

2018-12-09: Accept surrogate pairs as keyboard input. Issue
7337

2018-12-09: Ensure the session titlebar background and label
have the same color. Issue 7368

2018-12-09: When detaching from tmux and the gateway session
is automatically buried, restore it before closing the other
tmux tabs. This fixes a bug where it would forget it was a
hotkey window. Issue 7384.

2018-12-09: Fix a bug where the GPU renderer was never used
when a split pane was maximized.

2018-12-09: Run line buffer fast-vs-slow path sanity tests
1% of the time. Otherwise use only the slow path. Fix a
failing unit tests.

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Refactor a bunch of code
to help implement delta updates in metal. Add a per-line
generation that uniquely identifies it. Move per-frame state
into its own file.

2018-12-09: Tolerate illegal characters in integer profile
files (like scrollback lines) because they'll be removed
when editing ends

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] When reloading a profile,
wait until all sessions have updated their copy of the
profile before resizing the window to fit the new session
size. This fixes a bug where a window with multiple tabs
would shrink too much when reducing the font size. It would
shrink for the first tab, and then again for the second, and
so on. By having all sessions' fonts up to date before doing
fitWindowToTab, all sessions whose font sizes changed in
concert will request the same size.

2018-12-09: Change NSLog to DLog

2018-12-09: Synchronize creation of ASCII textures so you
don't create more than one of the same concurrently.
Synchronize access to shared ASCII texture cache (oops!).

2018-12-09: Update NMSSH to the latest version of my fork,
including libssh 1.8 and openssl 1.1.1. At commit
430310826b056b4cc53596c786fa6b7a8eb04bee of
https://githug.com/gnachman/NMSSH (the 'george' branch)

complaints

2018-12-09: Fix a retain cycle. Creation block -> framedata
-> dictionary -> text transient state -> creation block

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Fix a bug where
wrappedLinesFromIndex:width:count: would return an empty
array when the index equaled the start of a block other than
the first. Issue 7323

2018-12-09: Avoid calling
iTermUpdateCadenceController.description

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Add a fast path for
frequently accessed user defaults keys that sacrifices
thread safety for better speed on the main thread only

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Disable metal while a tab
drag is in progress so that its snapshot may be taken. Also,
fix a bug where we'd keep retrying to create a graphics
context for sessions without windows (such as those
belonging to non-current tabs) once a second. Not having a
window now causes metalAllowed: to return NO.

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Fix frames of dragged tabs
and windows

2018-12-09: Fix frame of dragged tab (as long as it doesn't
leave the tab bar)

2018-12-09: When the window size changes because scroller
appearance changed, preserve its height and adjust only the
width. Issue 7318 and 6198.

2018-12-09: Rename _scrollerStyleChanged and
refreshTmuxLayoutsAndWindow to make sense. Add comments and
logging.

2018-12-09: Fix a bug where images > 255 columns repeated.
Add the hack from commit be6ca89 to the GPU renderer. Issue
7316

2018-12-09: Fix GPU renderer for ASCII characters in fonts
that have a bounding box with a negative origin. In other
words, characters that draw excessively low. Issue 7299.

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Fix a bug where saving an
arrangement with a maximized pane also saves its contents.
Issue 7003. Also fix a bug where VT100Screen did not strip
NSNulls properly from its content. AFAICT this never gets
turned into a plist but it is poor form.

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Cache and re-use ASCII
textures to reduce time taken to switch tabs

2018-12-09: Log bounding boxes of characters to debug log

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Fix missing tabbar in
10.13

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] When exiting traditional
full screen mode show the menu bar after updating the
window's style mask. Changing the style mask causess
refreshTerminal: to be called, and that changes the
dock/menubar visibility. Issue 7300

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Refactor toggle
traditional full screen mode code

2018-12-09: [cherrypick from 3.2] Move all calls to
setHasShadow: to one method. Gives shadows to windows
without a title bar. Do not give shadows to full screen
windows (that logic was kind of there before but not done
consistently). See comment in issue 2057

2018-12-09: For compact+minimal: update colors when
switching panes and use good label colors in session title
views.

2018-12-09: Draw the background color on tab title labels
because macOS can't composite views correctly when subpixel
AA is on in Mojave. Issue 7176

2018-12-08: Add session>log>save contents. Issue 7404

2018-12-08: [python] bump version

2018-12-05: [python] Add movetab example

2018-12-05: [python] Fix a race condition where python would
send an request registering an RPC, iTerm2 would ack it and
immediately perform the RPC. The local registration happened
after the response was handled, but the RPC call beat it in
the race. This commit registers the RPC locally before
sending the request (which may or may not succeed). If the
request fails, it then unregisters it. This leaves the
script in a bit of a funny place while waiting for the
response. The RPC is registered from Python's POV but not
necessarily iTerm2's. I think this is safe, though. The
script reasonably expects the RPC to be called. The worst
case is there's some race and it gets called before it's
officially registered, but that would be a bug in iTerm2.
Issue 7232.

2018-12-05: Fix a bug where the gpu renderer didn't use
minimum contrast if the preceding character was a box
drawing character (or wrongly did use it when a box drawing
characters follows a non-boxdrawing character)

2018-12-05: Oops, forgot to include the code for the
previous commit.

2018-12-05: Add support for natively drawn powerline glyphs.
This fixes two annoying things: minimum contrast is not
applied to native box drawing glyphs, so now the powerline
arrows look right next to the solid background color when
minimum contrast is in use and; when you have extra vertical
spacing everything lines up properly. Issue 7372.

2018-12-05: Clean up prefs>keys. Make options in select
lists consistent and right align navigation shortcut labels

2018-12-05: [python] Add movetab example

2018-12-04: [api] Update cadence was not respected for
rpc-provided status bar components. Issue 7382.

2018-12-04: Refactor broadcast sessions to move most of the
code into a helper. Sessions are now tracked by their GUIDs
rather than by their views' IDs which can change when a view
is dragged. Issue 7381

2018-12-03: Remove window appearance when theme changes to
minimal. Issue 7370

2018-12-03: Fix the tab context menu in native full screen
in Mojave. Issue 7366. Mouse coordintaes were a lie when
gotten with mouseLocationOutsideOfEventStream. I have no
idea why this weird method was used. Also, the responder
chain is broken in this case, so just specify the target
directly.

2018-12-03: Only write out two parts of the Python version
in setup.py. We don't want to pin to dot releases

2018-12-03: Fix a bug where creating full environment
scripts failed because the directory was not created.
Improve logging when linking the environment in this case.

2018-12-03: Do not try to download a python runtime when
launching a full environment script. When launching a basic
script, if the python version specified only has one part
(e.g., python3) ignore it and use the latest.

2018-12-03: Ensure stanard window buttons in compact windows
have targets. Issue 7360

2018-12-02: [python] Add escindicator example

2018-12-01: [python] Add colorhost example

2018-12-01: Fix a retain cycle between iTermVariables.owner
and PTYSession that had the awful side effect of keeping
MTKView alive and drawing infinitely fast for
incomprehensible reasons (aside from MTKView being a
steaming ). Issue 7369

2018-12-01: [api] Freeze scripts at their initial Python
version forever.

My experience going from 3.6.5 to 3.7.0 was that backward
compatibility is going to be a serious problem for user
scripts. I don't want things to just break, so instead let's
keep scripts at their initial python version forever. This
seems to be keeping in the spirit of having a squillion
versions of Python installed because nobody wants to
maintain software because software is terrible. I'm sorry
for making it worse.

Details:

ARCify NSFileManager+iTerm

Respect python version in setup.py.

For basic scripts, change shebang to give 2-part python
version. When running a basic script, use that version.

If a particular python version is needed but is not present
download the newest runtime that includes it.

Change semantics of runtimes in the app support directory.
iterm2env is the latest, iterm2env-N is runtime version N,
and iterm2env-X.Y is python version X.Y (latest downloaded
bugfix) and iterm2env-X.Y.Z is python version X.Y.Z. They
are trees of hard links so they can survive deletion of each
other as upgrades happen.

When installing a python runtime for a full environment
script create hard links, don't unzip. This saves disk
space. This means the zip files don't need to be saved (so
they are not saved)

Write out setup.py files for full environment scripts
including python_requires='=x.y.z'. Scripts will be frozen
at their initial python version to avoid nasty surprises
when upgrading.

Update the basic script templates to specify Python 3.7.
I'll need to keep these up to date as new versions of Python
come out.

2018-11-29: Correct "Terminal.app Compatibility" keyboard
mapping preset to match   and   functionality. (#378)


2018-11-29: Disable address sanitizer in nightly builds

2018-11-29: Add assertions to
enumerateCharsInRange:charBlock:eolBlock: which somehow
overruns its buffer

2018-11-29: Make detection of cycles between session name
and badge less aggressive. They most both directly reference
each other.

2018-11-29: Don't follow weak links when building the
variable dictionary to avoid cycles

2018-11-29: [python] Add NewSessionMonitor and
random_color.rst example

2018-11-27: Multiply color values by 255 in
colorprests.Color's initializer when creating a color from a
proto, rather than when applying a color preset to a
profile. Now colors are always scaled 0-255. Also change the
default colorspace to calibrated since that's what iTerm2
uses internally, and profile color values often lack an
explicit color space. Add an example showing how to get
which preset a profile uses.

2018-11-25: Export simple script to full environment zip
file

2018-11-24: Make titlebar accessory look good in both light

Status bar components have infinities, and JSON can't
represent infinity.

2018-11-15: Somehow it is possible to get a DWC in the first
column. Do not stomp on memory if that unfortunate thing
happens. Was a hit from ASAN

https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2

2018-11-08: Fix a lot of spelling mistakes. PR 367 by
jsoref. Minor tweaks by gln.

2018-11-08: Update travis golden for box drawing. Looks
funny in the test output because alpha<1 but in practice it
looks fine.

only one time (#371)

Add RequestAttention=once to bounce the icon only one time.

2018-11-04: Cache the size of blocks in the line buffer to
make large history faster. Also, refactor session resizing.

2018-11-04: Change the default behavior to stretch tabs
horizontally. Two reasons: it gets us closer to looking like
system tabs at first glance; second, minimal/compact looks
awful without this and I expect this will be a popular
configuration

2018-11-04: Change how the password manager reveals and
edits passwords. Trying to do it inline in the table view
doesn't work, so do it in modal alerts instead. Fixes issue
7290

Tweak the frames of tab bar outlines, dividers, and fills so
everything lines up perfectly in mojave

than blending. Issue 7282

2018-11-04: [metal] Get rid of vestigial
postmultpliedRenderer and code to apply premultiplication

2018-11-04: Oops, I forgot to fix up the callsite and
declaration of temporarilyDisableMetal when it was renamed
to bounceMetal due to a cherrypick

2018-11-04: Use premultiplied alpha in transparent windows
with monochrome text on Mojave when using metal renderer.
This blends background colors closer to how the traditional
renderer does it. It's still slightly different which I
cannot yet account for.

2018-11-04: Fix wrong alpha when the tmux integration view
is just slightly smaller than the tab. In that case we try
to use the session's default background color for the
flexible view's color. The alpha computation was incorrect
making it appear transparent. Issue 7225

5543

2018-11-04: Try to fix the crash due to not being able to
allocate a graphics context. This commit forces the context
to be allocated on the main thread before metal is enabled.
Failures to allocate a graphics context will lead to a once
a second retry. It seems to fail due to waking from sleep,
per issue 7267.

2018-11-04: Fix analyzer-found issues. A leak in
linesInRange (issue 7264) and an uninitialized rect
(harmless in practice, but annoys the analyzer)

miniaturized. After deminiaturization make sure the window

window from one screen to another. See a detailed
investigation in issue 7099.

input is enabled

messages. It could be nil.

mostly occluded

2018-11-04: Only allocate one bitmap context per character
rendered, not 4.

2018-11-04: Fix some discrepancies in box drawing between
metal and traditional. When vertical spacing was added the
metal version was shifted up by half the shift. Also,
retinaRound was wrong and was responsible for 1-pixel errors
in Metal on retina displays. Issue 7152

2018-11-04: Trim spaces from background image filenames. Add
logging for issue 7138.

2018-11-04: Beg for full disk access.

would grow when toggling the disclosure. Issue 7243

configuration changes. It seems to be left in a broken state
if you have disconnect and reconnect a display.

2018-11-03: Don't crash when setting the current directory
to nil and using the git status bar tool

2018-11-03: Treat pressing the green button the same as
cmd-enter. Set window type to lion_full_screen while in lion
fullscreen. Set saved window type before entering. Fixes a
bug where the window content was under the tabbar. See
https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/7262#note_113046927
