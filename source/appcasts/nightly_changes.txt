Status bar components have infinities, and JSON can't
represent infinity.

column. Do not stomp on memory if that unfortunate thing
happens. Was a hit from ASAN

2018-11-08: Fix a lot of spelling mistakes. PR 367 by
jsoref. Minor tweaks by gln.

2018-11-08: Update travis golden for box drawing. Looks
funny in the test output because alpha<1 but in practice it
looks fine.

2018-11-06: Add RequestAttention once to bounce the app icon
only one time (#371)

Add RequestAttention=once to bounce the icon only one time.

2018-11-04: Cache the size of blocks in the line buffer to
make large history faster. Also, refactor session resizing.

2018-11-04: Change the default behavior to stretch tabs
horizontally. Two reasons: it gets us closer to looking like
system tabs at first glance; second, minimal/compact looks
awful without this and I expect this will be a popular
configuration

2018-11-04: Change how the password manager reveals and
edits passwords. Trying to do it inline in the table view
doesn't work, so do it in modal alerts instead. Fixes issue
7290

Tweak the frames of tab bar outlines, dividers, and fills so
everything lines up perfectly in mojave

drawn. The default compositing mode punches a hole rather
than blending. Issue 7282

2018-11-04: [metal] Get rid of vestigial
postmultpliedRenderer and code to apply premultiplication

2018-11-04: Oops, I forgot to fix up the callsite and
declaration of temporarilyDisableMetal when it was renamed
to bounceMetal due to a cherrypick

2018-11-04: Use premultiplied alpha in transparent windows
with monochrome text on Mojave when using metal renderer.
This blends background colors closer to how the traditional
renderer does it. It's still slightly different which I
cannot yet account for.

2018-11-04: Fix wrong alpha when the tmux integration view
is just slightly smaller than the tab. In that case we try
to use the session's default background color for the
flexible view's color. The alpha computation was incorrect
making it appear transparent. Issue 7225

2018-11-04: Only consider the first language. Issue 7265

2018-11-04: Fix drawing non-black box drawing characters in
Mojave without subpixel AA. Issue 7275

allocate a graphics context. This commit forces the context
to be allocated on the main thread before metal is enabled.
Failures to allocate a graphics context will lead to a once
a second retry. It seems to fail due to waking from sleep,
per issue 7267.

2018-11-04: Fix analyzer-found issues. A leak in
linesInRange (issue 7264) and an uninitialized rect
(harmless in practice, but annoys the analyzer)

miniaturized. After deminiaturization make sure the window
fits on the screen. Issue 7213

mostly occluded

2018-11-04: Only allocate one bitmap context per character
rendered, not 4.

2018-11-04: Fix some discrepancies in box drawing between
metal and traditional. When vertical spacing was added the
metal version was shifted up by half the shift. Also,
retinaRound was wrong and was responsible for 1-pixel errors
in Metal on retina displays. Issue 7152

2018-11-04: Trim spaces from background image filenames. Add
logging for issue 7138.

if you have disconnect and reconnect a display.

2018-11-03: Don't crash when setting the current directory
to nil and using the git status bar tool

2018-11-03: Treat pressing the green button the same as
cmd-enter. Set window type to lion_full_screen while in lion
fullscreen. Set saved window type before entering. Fixes a
bug where the window content was under the tabbar. See
https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/7262#note_113046927

2018-11-03: Merge branch 'master' of
https://github.com/gnachman/iterm2

2018-10-29: Deal with pushing a nil title onto the stack.
When it's popped, return nil so the fallback title algorithm
will be used. Issue 7204

2018-10-29: Don't use the compact window subclass for
traditional full screen windows because they then get a
title bar. Mentioned by @microtiger in issue 7262.

2018-10-29: Remove inset from tab bar in full screen. Issue
7262

banner

2018-10-29: [python] Fix API docs table of contents

let whatever random crap was in the drawable remain.

2018-10-28: Remove dead code

2018-10-28: Add the option to span background image across
multiple panes.

This commit refactors the background drawing code and
implements it separately in the GPU and traditional
renderer.

2018-10-28: Fix bugs in background image drawing scale to
fill/fit. The source rectangle has to be clipped to the
legal image rect. Any coordinates outside the image rect
will be drawn by the boxes.

bug where a restored compact/minimal window in lion
fullscreen exits fullscreen to a visible title bar.

leaking.

2018-10-16: Reparent NSScroller to improve drawing
performance on Mojave

2018-10-16: Change how LANG is computed. Try
language+country+encoding, then language+country, then
language. Use same algorithm regardless of OS version.
Ignore everything after the first - in the language since
locales do not look like zh-Hans_CN.UTF-8, but do look like
zh_CN.UTF-8

2018-10-16: Hide window shadow in mojave when there is a
transparent session. Thanks apple

2018-10-16: Improve peformance when blinking text is enabled
and scrollback history is enormous. Fetching the lines was
the bottleneck. This avoids walking the whole block array
for each line.

nonascii font is enabled; otherwise it defaults to NO. Issue
7187

2018-10-16: Add ITAssertWithMessage and use it in
iTermCharacterSource

2018-10-16: Seems like sessionDidBecomeActive: can be called
without a preceding call to sessionDidResignActive:. Or
maybe didBecome gets called twice? Who knows.

2018-10-16: Fix a bunch of bugs in the IME. First, it
crashed if the marked text had a double width character
starting at the end of a line. The colors were wrong. The
cursor was to narrow. It drew garbage on the last lines when
the marked text caused the screen contents to scroll up.

2018-10-16: Add some sanity checks to track down a crash
where a context is nil when drawing ascii characters for the
metal renderer

(for when you're using a floating hotkey window and another
app is active)

2018-10-16: Make the close session confirmation into a sheet

2018-10-16: Make app active before opening prefs panel. If
you're in a floating hotkey window this fixes a bug where it

not activated when you open a floating hotkey window)

2018-10-16: Use normal window background color on Mojave
unless the window is transparent

2018-10-16: [metal] Don't draw underline past right boundary

CGContextSetShouldSmoothFonts in the traditional renderer.
Interestingly this affects stroke thickness.

2018-10-16: Fix a leak of CGContextREf's in the character
source. It allocated them in init and in
initializeStateIfNeededWithFont but only dealloced the ones
in init.

2018-10-16: Always use font smoothing on 10.13 and earlier.
This fixes a bug where subpixel AA was broken in 10.13 and
earlier.

because there's no graphics context and that causes a
warning

2018-10-16: Update goldens. Goodbye subpixel antialiasing.
Fix a few other tests: change how swizzling user defaults
works for the new caching advanced settings, and on 10.14
skin tone modifiers combine with the letter g for some
reason.

2018-10-16: Add usage descriptions for everything I can
find. Fixes issues like 7132

2018-10-16: Use the right frame (ignoring a hidden menu bar)
for edge-spanning windows. Issue 7149

2018-10-06: Fix bad printf format

2018-10-06: Fix vertical alignment of status bar contents.
Text is now vertically aligned so the center of caps is in

everywhere. When in the pane titlebar the horizontal divider
under it is visible.

2018-10-06: Add logging for issue 7053

2018-10-04: Fix typo in advanced settings (#368)


2018-10-02: Improve background color of tmux integration
windows on 10.14. The flexible view used to draw under all
the session views and they would punch a hole through the
window. In 10.14, compositing works, so they now overlap and
appear to have a less opaque background color. Issue 7147

2018-10-02: [python] Add docs for the new focus module

2018-10-02: Really draw two frames before showing metal
view. Seems to either fix or mostly prevent the issue where

retract my previous comment about understanding asyncio.

2018-10-02: [Python] Greatly simplify how we use asyncio and
websockets.

I think I finally understand how asyncio is supposed to
work! This design is a million times better, and fixes a
deadlock that the previous design had. Ahhhh

2018-10-01: Fix support for subpixel AA on Mojave. This
reverts to the 10.13 code paths when
CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled is set to NO regardless
of OS version.

2018-10-01: [python] Bump version
