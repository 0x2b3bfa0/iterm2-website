Menu Item Identifiers
---------------------

To refer to a menu item you must use its unique identifier. The kind of identifier you use depends on the version of macOS you have.

For macOS 10.12 and newer, identifiers are stable and do not change over time.

On older versions of macOS, you use `Title Paths`_. A title path is a concatenation of menu item titles. This is because of a limitation imposed by the OS.
