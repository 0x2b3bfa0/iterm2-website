		iTerm2 should require little explanation for users accustomed to terminal emulators. Even if you are an experienced user, take the time to read through the <a href="documentation-highlights.html">highlights</a> section of this document. It will familiarize you with some features of iTerm2 that you may not have seen in other terminal emulators that can make a real difference in the way you work.

		<p class="answer">iTerm2 features Applescript support which allows you to automate many aspects of its behavior. Quite a bit of customization is also possible by writing shell scripts.</p>
		<h5>Applescript</h5>
		<h6 class="question">Example Script</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			iTerm2 has sophisticated Applescript support allowing one to write stand-alone scripts to launch the application and open multiple sessions with profiles into either new tabs or new windows. You can also set some other parameters for a session such as foreground and background colors, and transparency. Here is a sample script:
		</p>
		<div class="panel code">
<pre>
-- A sample iTerm2 Applescript 

tell application "iTerm" 
activate  

-- close the first session 
terminate the first session of the first terminal 

-- make a new terminal 
set myterm to (make new terminal)  

-- talk to the new terminal 
tell myterm  

-- set size 
set number of columns to 100 
set number of rows to 50 
-- make a new session 
set mysession to (make new session at the end of sessions)  

-- talk to the session 
tell mysession  

-- set some attributes 
set name to "tcsh" 
set foreground color to "red" 
set background color to "blue" 
set transparency to "0.6"  

-- execute a command 
exec command "/bin/tcsh"  

end tell -- we are done talking to the session  

-- we are back to talking to the terminal  

-- launch a default shell in a new tab in the same terminal 
launch session "Default Session"  

-- launch a saved session. 
launch session "Root Shell" 
-- select the previous session 
select mysession 
-- get the tty name of a session 
set myttyname to the tty of the first session 
-- refer to a session by its tty/id 
tell session id myttyname 
set foreground color to "yellow" 
end tell  

end tell  

-- talk to the first terminal 
tell the first terminal  

-- launch a default shell in a new tab in the same terminal 
launch session "Default Session"  

tell the last session  

-- write some text 
write text "cd Projects/Cocoa/iTerm2" 
-- write the contents of a file 
write contents of file "/path/to/file/"  

end tell  

end tell  

-- reposition window and name it 
set the bounds of the first window to {100, 100, 700, 700} 
set the name of the first window to "A Window Title"   


end tell

			These scripts can then be saved as stand-alone executable applications.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">Autolaunching Scripts</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			iTerm2 also supports autolaunching of an Applescript on startup. On startup, iTerm2 looks for an Applescript file in "~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/AutoLaunch.scpt". If it is found, the "AutoLauch.scpt" script is launched and executed.
		</p>
		<h6 class="question">User-Defined Scripts</h6>
		<p class="answer">
			iTerm2 also supports launching of user defined scripts from the "Scripts" menu. The scripts need to be stored under the ~/Library/Application Support/iTerm/Scripts directory. You can create this directory if it does not already exist. iTerm2 checks this directory on startup.
