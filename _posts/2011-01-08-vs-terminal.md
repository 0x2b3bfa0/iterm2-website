title: iTerm2 vs. Terminal.app
---

iTerm2 offers many innovative features not found in Terminal.app:

### Full Screen Mode

Work distraction-free. Press Cmd-Enter to make iTerm2 fill your screen.

### 256-Color Support

The terminal is a medley of color. Vim explodes with photorealism. Code comes alive.

### Switch Tabs with Cmd-Number

Work faster by switching tabs with Cmd-Number instead of using the mouse or going one by one.

### Split Panes

While Terminal lets you split the window to view two different parts of the same session, in iTerm2 you can split a tab into multiple panes, dividing it horizontally or vertically, and each pane shows a different session. You can create as many split panes as you want and arrange them in any way. You can navigate among them with keyboard or mouse. Inactive panes are slightly dimmed.

### Autocomplete

An iTerm2 exclusive feature. Type the start of a word and press Cmd-;. A popup window opens at the cursor position with completion suggestions.

### Instant Replay

An iTerm2 exclusive feature. Press Cmd-Option-B and a control opens that allows you to move back in time. If you're using an interactive application, the scrollback buffer doesn't capture everything that's happened. With Instant Replay, you can see exactly what was on your screen at any point in the past.

### Mouseless Copy-Paste

An iTerm2 exclusive feature. Open the Find bar and perform a search. The match will be highlighted. Then press the tab key and the selection will expand to the right; shift-tab expands it to the left. It is automatically copied to the clipboard! Pressing option-enter pastes it immediately.

### Visor-style Hotkey Support

You can associate a keyboard shortcut that shows iTerm2 when you are in another application. Pressing it a second time hides iTerm2 and returns you to where you were.

### Paste History

The last 20 values that you copied from iTerm2 or pasted into it are remembered. You can even opt to save them to disk. You can see the list with Cmd-Shift-H and search it quicksilver-style. Making a selection immediately pastes the value.

### High Quality Search

In iTerm (and almost every other terminal emulator), performing a search (Cmd-F) opens a window that hides part of the text you want to search. iTerm2 uses a modern find UI that fits in a bar at the bottom of the window, like Firefox does. It defaults to searching in reverse, but you can use shift-Enter to search forwards too.

### Best Input Method Editor Support on Mac OS

Several improvements over iTerm's IME appear in iTerm2. Text wraps around lines properly and will scroll the screen if you enter more than fits. Integration with third-party input method editors like AquaSKK works properly.

### Smart Cursor Color

Turning on this feature ensures that the cursor is always visible by setting a minimum threshold for contrast. Never lose your cursor again!

### Separate Actions for Left and Right Option Keys

A critical option for emacs users who work with international text. You can assign one option key to send Esc+ or Meta and the other to work normally for inputting non-keyboard characters.

### Taggable and Searchable Bookmarks

If you use a huge number of bookmarks (a bookmark is a saved configuration that can be tied to a particular server), iTerm2 makes it easy to organize and search them using tags.

**BUT iTerm2 IS IN ALPHA!**
The stability of iTerm2 varies from release to release. Major features that are planned for the first full release haven't been implemented yet, and until that day it will not receive Beta status. That said, many (hundreds to thousands) of people use iTerm2 e
