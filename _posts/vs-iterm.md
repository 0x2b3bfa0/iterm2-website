title: iTerm2 vs. iTerm
---

iTerm2 offers numerous advantages over iTerm. To sum up:

## PERFORMANCE

iTerm had terrible performance when resizing a window, sometimes taking several minutes. This has been fixed. iTerm was noticeably slower than Terminal.app. This has been fixed. What more is there to say?

## BUGS

Every reproducible bug in iTerm has been fixed. This included some crashes and redraw bugs, and plenty besides.

## FEATURES

iTerm2 offers innovative features, many of them not found in any other terminal emulator, plus basic features that iTerm lacked:

### Profiles and Bookmarks Nightmare Simplified

Profiles are gone. The bookmarks UI is easy to use. The preferences panel is completely rewritten and simple to learn. The difference is night and day. If you have a lot of bookmarks, they are now taggable and searchable.

### Split Panes

An iTerm2 exclusive feature. You can split a tab into multiple panes, dividing it horizontally or vertically. You can create as many split panes as you want and arrange them in any way. You can navigate among them with keyboard or mouse. Inactive panes are slightly dimmed.

### Autocomplete

An iTerm2 exclusive feature. Type the start of a word and press Cmd-;. A popup window opens at the cursor position with completion suggestions.

### Instant Replay

An iTerm2 exclusive feature. Press Cmd-Option-B and a control opens that allows you to move back in time. If you're using an interactive application, the scrollback buffer doesn't capture everything that's happened. With Instant Replay, you can see exactly what was on your screen at any point in the past.

### Mouseless copy-paste

An iTerm2 exclusive feature. Open the Find bar and perform a search. The match will be highlighted. Then press the tab key and the selection will expand to the right; shift-tab expands it to the left. It is automatically copied to the clipboard! Pressing option-enter pastes it immediately.

### Visor-style hotkey support

You can associate a keyboard shortcut that shows iTerm2 when you are in another application. Pressing it a second time hides iTerm2 and returns you to where you were.

### Paste history

The last 20 values that you copied from iTerm2 or pasted into it are remembered. You can even opt to save them to disk. You can see the list with Cmd-Shift-H and search it quicksilver-style. Making a selection immediately pastes the value.

### High-quality Search

In iTerm (and almost every other terminal emulator), performing a search (Cmd-F) opens a window that hides part of the text you want to search. iTerm2 uses a modern find UI that fits in a bar at the bottom of the window, like Firefox does. It defaults to searching in reverse, but you can use shift-Enter to search forwards too.

### Best input method editor support on Mac OS

Several improvements over iTerm's IME appear in iTerm2. Text wraps around lines properly and will scroll the screen if you enter more than fits. Integration with third-party input method editors like AquaSKK works properly.

### Smart cursor color

Turning on this feature ensures that the cursor is always visible by setting a minimum threshold for contrast. Never lose your cursor again!

### Flashing visual bell

It seems every terminal except iTerm had a flashing visual bell. This one is extremely noticeable. Stop missing those important alerts!

### Separate actions for left and right option keys

A critical option for emacs users who work with international text. You can assign one option key to send Esc+ or Meta and the other to work normally for inputting non-keyboard characters.


**BUT iTerm2 IS IN ALPHA!**

The stability of iTerm2 varies from release to release. Major features that are planned for the first full release haven't been implemented yet, and until that day it will not receive Beta status. That said, many (hundreds to thousands) of people use iTerm2 every day. While some versions are more stable than others, there have been several trouble-free versions released. It's at least worth a try!
