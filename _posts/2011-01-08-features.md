## Shiny New Features

* Split panes: Divide a tab up into multiple panes, each one of which shows a different session. You can slice vertically and horizontally and create any number of panes in any imaginable arrangement.
* Hotkey: Register a hotkey that brings iTerm2 to the foreground when you're in another application. A terminal is always a keypress away.
* Autocomplete: Just type the start of a word that has ever appeared in your window and then Cmd-; will pop open a window with suggestions. The word you're looking for is usually on top of the list!
* Mouseless copy-paste. Use the slick Find feature to locate text, and expand the selection, copy, and paste it all with your keyboard.
* Paste history lets you revisit recently copied or pasted text. You can even opt to have the history saved to disk so it will never be lost.
* Instant replay lets you travel back in time. It's like TiVo for your terminal!
