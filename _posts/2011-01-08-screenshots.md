## Find Bar

Check out the slick Find bar. Not only does it search as you type, but it
includes a "mouseless copy-paste" feature. Once you have a found a result,
pressing the tab key expands it and it's automatically copied to the
clipboard. Alt-enter immediately pastes the selection and returns the cursor
to the terminal.

## Split Panes

Divide your window up into multiple panes that each show a different session.
You can split horizontally or vertically, create as many as fit on the
screen, and resize them independently. Use the keyboard to navigate among
panes. Notice that the inactive panes (those not receiving keyboard input)
are slightly dimmed to make it easy to find your cursor.

## Paste History

Paste History remembers the last 20 values that you copied or pasted in
iTerm2. The list is searchable just like Quicksilver.

## Autocomplete

Type the start of a word and Cmd-; pops up an autocomplete window with
suggestions. Pick one and press enter and it's inserted, or search the
list Quicksilver-style.

## Instant Replay

It's like TiVo for your terminal! Ever had something disappear from your
screen and not go into the scrollback buffer? You can rewind time with
Instant Replay. The slider on the bottom lets you navigate through time,
re-showing exactly what was on your screen.

## Custom Colors

Customize ALL the colors to your preferences, not just the foreground
and background colors.

## Transparency and Blur

Windows can be transparent, and they can even blur the contents behind them.
