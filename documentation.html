		iTerm2 should require little explanation for users accustomed to terminal emulators. Even if you are an experienced user, take the time to read through the <a href="documentation-highlights.html">highlights</a> section of this document. It will familiarize you with some features of iTerm2 that you may not have seen in other terminal emulators that can make a real difference in the way you work.
